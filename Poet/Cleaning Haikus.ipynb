over the valley the garden empty a single bellsound nudges mourning doves on the roof ridge a single bluejay ruffled by autumn wind worries the sunflower a single horse tied to the rail this quiet evening a small new grave the young father whispers a lullaby a snail on the earth a sentimental journey by centimeters a soft cluck and the old plow horse plods forward a sonic boom shakes the confederate gravestone dogwood petals fall a spattering of pink petals around the tombstone nd airborne a spring sunset the poets pen suspended swaying old pine a stone snug in the curve of a cottonwood root a stranger passing starts saying something his hat falls off a summer moon the slow breathing of her eighthmonth belly a summer moon the slow breathing of her eighthmonth belly a

old woman at the waters edge flowers pinned to her hat oleander leaves shadow dance on the hot wall storm clouds gathering none other replies as again and again the screech owl cries on a clear day she touches the shadow of her child on a moonless night in the middle of winter that mockingbird on black water floating candles for the dead the rivers silence on crusted snow one crow and his shadow make two blackbirds on fathers grave a stand of daisies from last years bouquet on first waking wondering for a moment what season it is on my paddy dike crowded in summer sunshine the bearded iris on my upturned thumb ladybug too waits patiently for a ride on plates clusters of fishbones this evening the kitchen is empty on silent cables the lift chairs hang a rush of wind on stone he scratches in pig latin his dead friends name on the abandoned car the forsale sign fading day by day on the altar two candles do their prayers with only shadows on the balcony the strings of a bikini some squid drying on the basketball hoop a dragonfly the child delays his shot on the blue iris a soap bubble has left its soap on the bowery corner an old alley cat cleans his face on the boys chest a smudge of hair the bearded iris on the bright shirt of the new scarecrow a butterfly alights on the coldest day of the year the exchange of hostages on the country road a slow beetle crosses the headlights path on the fence post circling the christmas wreath a green lizard on the first day of spring nothing a clear blue sky on the front porch the empty chair rocks a cold wind on the frozen snow reflecting ambulance lights the rag dolls face on the grass a coiled snakes skin springs in the wind on the high road on the metal trunks sunbeam sparkles coldly on the high trail shapeless clump of black feathers drifting cirrus on the highway pools that are not there hot summer day on the hot sand flickering of a gulls eye opalescent clams on the meadow her worn jeans trimmed with queen annes lace on the melting snow how bright the breast of that robin on the midnight train a mumbling a stiletto someone elses chest on the old bus a bag lady sits mummering magic spells on the old womans lawn

tinged with pink and birdsong only a trickle over the rocks but louder than summer torrents only empty brown pods on the milkweed they fill with wind only four golden pippins this year in the old

from the sea a boys pierced ear the full moon rises over the shallow sea some yellow ginger the funeral mass in the holy water fount confetti and rice the gauze wrap i wake up in a box of moonlight the gently lapping waves having to leave while the seagull stays the glow of summer fruit light on its way around it the gray mourning dove welcoming my visitor with his own greeting the great drought becomes a brown cow which becomes a moo the grieving woman beneath the wisteria white moths in her hair the guide posing beneath eight black bears not taken for meat the hawk landing catches the sunset light in his cupped wings the heat sweltering kitten helping me with my ice cream bar the horse tethered to the lodgepole pine shakes dew on itself the horseshoe crab moved toward the tidal pool a windblown shell the hum of the fan cigarette smoke streams though our silence the imaginary sparrow sheltered by the empty box lays an egg the instant after can t stop rains in the winter surf the iron ladle sparks on the wellstone the evening is cold the jelly fish floats just shakily on the sea always shakily the june roses petals falling to the floor her heavy breathing the kitchen floor has no more black marks from his shoes the kitchen floor has no more black marks from his shoes the lake sways in its skin of shadows just before sundown the parvenus beam unaware that each lampshade is showing its seam the lawn with the rocks even the dandelions know the way the limestone chimney smokes from the iron stove a tinkling cowbell the little boy at the fireworks stand just can t decide the little child eats each single grape counting one by one the little girl hangs all the ornaments on the nearest branch the little girl hangs all the ornaments on the nearest branch the lonely beach can it really be made with brass dust the long day our happenings wound around a thread of rain the long winter another story in the news about viet nam the loon dives the fragrance of the firs across the lake the loon dives what was her name with the strange laugh the mallard pair straight up from the stream through falling leaves the maples shadow a bright edge of frost in the sun turning her eyes blaze blue starlight crystalcaptured secrets that mock me m with passing rain our laughter finally quietens the silence beckons the melting snow tinder old camomile stems the white egg case the mission bell silent and no one harvests the prickly pears the misty trail finding a walking stick banana slug on it the moon full plum trees in bloom we meet with lanterns the moon overhead all around the city sounds the moon overhead the moonlit study old tairo fallen asleep haiku book in hand the moonsized sun translucent in the fog crows in autumn trees the morning bleakness a meadowlark crosses the slant of the rain the most beautiful words in the english language are chocolate fudge the moth holes in her sweater as she talks about death the moths climb to heaven the stones let their shadows go the mountain rests foothills deep in haze summit lost in smoke the mountain rumbles smoke from her hidden fires joins passing clouds the near cicadas then the far cicadas now the silent grove the new picket fence between two slats a tea rose opens the night watchman red arc of his cigarette over the snowbank the night you tell me the diagnosis starlight skids down icicles the night you tell me the diagnosis starlight skids down icicles the old calendar numbers like bright barbed hooks hanging there still the old crabapple yesterday a few blossoms today full of bees the old doll her mama box broken to half a cry the old fiddle how it rests in his hand without sound the old garden fence now keeps the goldenrod from the goldenrod the old ice fisherman warms them in his mouth fisheye bait the old indian preparing for her death too late for flowers the old lighthouse historical marker in front halfway to the pole the old man sits enthralled past midnight first outdoor christmas tree the old man sleeps a digital clock reports minute by minute the old mans cane unsteadily pointing out the seedlings first leaf the old pond a frog jumps in the sound of water the pages of the days turned by an invisible hand watermarks the pale face at a highrise window sparrows on the street the pale morning moon between the cables of the suspension bridge the parting of the year quiet rain soaks the withered chestnuts the patio party where we meethow venus flares in white wine the pavement heat caught in the roar of the broken muffler the peace lily opens   still this rift between us the peony clipped a sort of afterimage shines where it grew the phone remains silent morning and afternoon is spent writing poems the plow stands idle on cracklipped earth a dry wind blowing the plum tree in snow windblown petals disappear in mounting drifts the plump lady falls down the marble church steps harvest moon the pool in winter isolated blades of grass preserved in ice the potato thieves exclaim in low voices at the falling star the precise beauty of the spiders web marred by the mayfly the puddle surface alive with light wind its mud with tadpoles the puppets remarks make me blush how gray my hair is the quail shakes itself slowly spring dust settles on bared radishes the quiet old man clutching a glossy photo a removal van the rain soaks into the croak of the frogs silently

gently the river ganges scores of priests and hippies mingle at sunrise the river runs high smoldering logs and corpses drift roll bump the roofingtar that humid afternoon is good now in smoky tea the rumpled blanket all that remains of a long winter afternoon the samoyed sleeping on her back by the cold glass door the scarecrow casts his shadow today too in this passing world the scarecrow is dead his clothes given to the church rummage the seance ended in the mediums house a door slams shut the setting sun lighting up the floats of the crab traps the shed door shuts a dragonfly skeleton flies into the dark the silence of a spinning wheel as a potter shapes clay the silence after geese fade from sight part of me following the sky aprilblue from the plowed cornfield a burst of blackbirds the sky blue boat makes a path through the new duckweed the slow pace of pallbearers high in the cedar childrens faces the small boy unwrapping sweets in his pocket the swooping pigeons the small scar on her cheek a dimple when she smiles the sound of swallows in my chimney flutters down precarious place the sound of thunder lightning disappears to flash at another site the sparkle of it the salesmans

summer train jazz sounds come from a napping mans headphones the sun clouds over some hawthorn berries fall on waterlily pads the sun setting red up in the boulders buddha is dozing the surgeon speaking seeing only the stillness held within his hands the swamp dry reeds soundless in autumn dusk frog voices return the talk in the street of the teenage suicide the heat the talk turns to mothers tomato seeds spill from her knife the tattered web in the tattered bathhouse full of old laughter the telephone booth is holding the old wino in frozen silence the television leans into the tip face all the wires torn the tellers perfume still sharp in my thin fold of money the theatre of winter begins bare trees black crows vistas opened the tide comes in on a beach without castles autumn begins the time it takes for snowflakes to whiten the distant pines the time it takes for snowflakes to whiten the distant pines the tiny pine strains against its bonsai wire this april day the tiny sweet gum leafless branches dripping buffets the storm winds the toy robot moves round and round the tree christmas morning the tremulous legs of the newborn colt thrum of cool rain the upper

down the onion rows this bobbing blossom lunchtime for the minnow school or target practice this deepening cold in the back of my truck another calf this dream of burnt ivory sleeping in the next room intractable this earth imposes endless boundaries on us shall we accept them this evening a migraine  all the songs of summer birds this heat cows graze in shadows cast by a nuclear plant this long illness again i press my back against the pine this mornings sunrise light on the rippling water a fallen blossom this night of no moon the sound of rain on peonies this old shell no longer holds sea sounds only sand mites this quiet morning atip the milkweed bloom how still the butterfly this same flower i looked at yesterday is not the same this summer day from the look of sunflowers should last forever this summers seaweed hangs brown and twisted by the potted fern this veterans day old men march in formation reeking of mothballs this winter day the world seems godless knocking at the door

twirls and twirls through the darkened trees the basketball court lit like a shrine through the open door of a distant barn a window flashes through the roar of heavy rain thunder of a passing freight through the window full autumn moon i forgot to wash it through the window the same old face staring out staring in through the window slats of the therapists office a traffic light through the yucca spikes the full moon speared for a moment through winter air through the bare trees a crows dusky voice thumbing into town in the bonechilling wind the old scarecrows stare thumbs touching an old monk

the hen struts by my mothers grave with quick brown fingers the reaper of reeds and willow bark with their pipes hunched under spring sky old men make clouds with their pipes hunched under spring sky old men make clouds with this pencil the long jail term dwindling to a nub within the soft green moss white quartz as heavy as me without a breeze the silence of the windchime by the stream without a place to die crouches where he pleases winter fly without a place to die crouches where he pleases winter fly without beginning or end the silvery trail that designs this walk woman and her pillow

mouse exposed to the wind wrapped in his towel she bends to smell his wet curls wrapped in their egos against threatened rejection snails braving their ways wringing out my socks mother so wan i wring my hands writing haiku too white sounds of a tennis ball solitary player yanked from the clothesline the sound of the sheet becoming wind year of the dragon my fathers harmonica silent yet another year yellow butterfly do you know bitter from sweet happiness from grief yelping at the cold diving off an anchored boat skinny dippers yes spring is here even the old scarecrow gets spruced up you read lying on the mattress wearing nothing but your glasses you stare at the moon the dark side of your heart you re here but the wine i d saved is gone young green leaves mirrored in the crystal beads of my rosary young green leaves mirrored in the crystal beads of my rosary your name i got drunk and forgot it ferris wheel lights your old bluejay in this falls oak leaves the same sunshine your warm breath on my neck winter moon in the tree a beautiful day the clink of another coin in the blindmans cup a bend in the bayou an old alligator swallows the sun nightfall a blank sheet of paper glides off the table by a sigh a blue sky only the dank ground reminds us of the rain a blue umbrella then a bare head and then two back umbrellas a bridge in spring from both banks new leaves narrow the river a brush of scarlet on winter grey abandoned berries on the ash a buddhist priests bell my sister gone gone gone that winter evening a cars dragging muffler throws a trail of sparks cold autumn night a card tells of his death winters first icicles in the window a child could do that the woman stomps from matisses purple robe a childs voice at the whiteandpink patterned roses in a light rain a chill in the air i put a sweater on my grandchild a clown shouts life lithe in the lines you can t untangle a common beggar how badly his donation of rare blood was needed a crocus or two through the icy window faces in a dream a crowd in spring rain all opening umbrellas mushrooms by the pond a dandelion white down flying in the wind deep deep rooted stem a dark cold morning trees throw themselves together as best they can a deep winter day my boots in cedar shavings stir sudden summer a doe nibbles gently keeping a watchful eye on her hidden fawn a drifting feather carried by a silent breeze floating down to earth a drunk asleep on the beach his mouth open to the sky a dull red sunset across the new puddles twigs of ice grow a fading daisy the breeze blows the petals off and passes on a fat bald eagle on a wooden fencepost digests the summer afternoon a feeling i can t put in any rucksack the last step a few glowing leaves fly up from the bonfire and float away a few red leaves strokes of the rower quicken near the dock a field of poppies through the haze dark drops on the bed a fledgling blue jay leaning out from a branch before taking flight a flopping crucifix how like a bell to see the priest run a foot of new snow on the picnic table still the cracks a fugue is running up the stairs of daffodils blossoming in line a gray dove and i visit my fathers grave the lengthening nights a gray winter day music from the carousel drifts through the playground a great snowball feel its chill near snowy pines and brilliant clouds a green oasis this cool terrace high above the hot gray city a green sunday morning in back yards quiet sunshine persistent church bells a grey day dragging not even wind or rain the phone rings a hawks flight past the crumbling barn the moon starts to fall a highrise collapses the sound of highpitched screams from floor to floor a hint of pale sun this february noon a wasp lumbers by a hole in the clouds opening winter sunlight the woodpile just split a jade frog gazes over a sapphire pool not even a breeze a jet plane flying over flocks of waterfowl unconcerned within the breakwater a leaf between the pages the autumn that she put it there a little awkward still from the wools of winter the maypole dancers a lone owl on a telephone pole hoots at a cloudwrapped moon a long line of cars at santa rita prison

dark and cold galaxy flowing clear a pebble in my shoe six of us bear the casket uphill a piece of buttered popcorn floats in the garden pond swirling colors a pleasure in fear let your blood run cold for true exhilaration a plum blossom petal falls into a shadow at night unheard unseen a plum tree withers under an orange halfmoon alone in the meadow a puppy pestering gulls they fly he follows they fly he follows a quiet crossroads on the door of an empty store opportunity shop a ravens song the cupped palms of my hands holding the darkness a red rose in vase surrounded by green leaves survives the heat a rickety ladder propped against an apple branch a long way down a rocket bursts from the amusement park sounds of the roller coaster a room of my own the first guest to come a dragonfly a rose stem taped over a name petals lying on the ground a rustling sound in the marsh the sandhill cranes settle into sleep a rutted log road gone from the map my new boots squeaking a sailboat turning with the autumn wind caught the flame of eternity a sasanqua tree a white petal falls softly on the winter pond a second stroke and what has it brought flowers without a name a ships horn blowing to the nightmountain sounding a soft stone echo a shoe halfrisen from the gravel dust stirring far down the road a single firefly these brief glimpses of her face filling the silence a small green bird the color of sprouting leaves moves among them a small pale woman stares out to sea the chipped porcelain cup a song sparrow on the locked garden gate grass in its beak a sound my neighbor raking leaves into mounds under the midnight moon a speckled hen walking in dark march mud and i become sad a spring rain the same on both sides of the big wall a spring rain the same on both sides of the big wall a squid fisherman casts and retrieves casts and retrieves harvest moon rising a stranger one night walked the road disappeared through viels of rain a street of white cars glistening in the moonlight first october frost a sudden shower a large green beetle also runs on the walk a tendril swaying long after the bird has flown the garden quiet a thousand miles away else i d slip these

transparent wind a turtle raises its head as high as it will go dawn a vulture clouds the mind sweep of wing angel at the door a waterfront bar one for the tattooed seaman one for his parrot a weedchoked garden you hoe rusting in the shed our bed halfempty a white lily swaying veiled by a bamboo blind the afternoon breeze a whole night of snow the pinetrees this morning all bundled up a whorled shell into the roar of the surf a plovers cry a wild canary tries to undo my clothesline why am i smiling a windless morning and still the plum blossoms flutter to the ground a winter morning bulbuls flock together in a corner of the grove a winter onion buried in the compost kicks off its shroud spring a wisp of thin smoke writes the sealhunters presence across the sky a woman buries a rock engraved with the shadow of her son a woman pilgrim doing a slight makeup on completion of her journey a wooden footbridge boys stomp to hear the echo bare drooping willow a m approaching the harvest moon has taken away the whole night abandoned so long fireweed up through flooring of the old farm porch abortion clinic the young womans blue eyes stare at the white ceiling above the cold waves constellation of the crab crawling through the clouds above the felled oak the paper lady struts in high black boots above the gables and the crisscross of wires the pale summer moon acid in our tea we get drunk in a pub with fishermen across the sidewalk an empty coke can rolls from a paper bag adolescent sun plays a game across bald fields teasing tufts of grass after a strip search old inmates new inmates in blue prison garb after all that commotion on her bed the cat sleeps so peacefully after last night s heavy snow the morning wind blows delicately cold after lovemaking a faint smell of burning wax from the candles flame after midnight mass the churchs dark silent night a trace of incense after summer rain windowdraped on a dead tree strings of sparkling beads after the fall my handprints in the mud fill up with water after the funeral you leave the car i turn up the radio after the hearing pigeons stray in easy flight from the clock tower after the ice storm hanging from the bird feeder a twisted stick after the party i shake out the tablecloth rice against the snow after the party the moon goes crunch crunch along the new snow after the rain on my vegetable patch a new crop of stones after the rain only the sound of dripping in the kitchen pan after the rain on the childs tombstone a chipmunk grooms its fur after the schoolbus how still the abandoned fort in the morning snow after the service the cane no longer curves into my fathers hand after the shot a redtailed hawk dragging her weight across the field after the snowstorm tracks of the cat thawing on the

i forgot his hug little soundless sounds stir in the silent stillness of the summer night locked in a white buick three hounds arroo through a crackedopen window locking the door shutting my eyes the wind still inside my head long after hes gone hearing him still the wind through the trees long after sundown the sound of ripe plums plumping on the ground long after sunset the same plover still playing along the ebb tide long cold spell my canary grows to ignore the tea kettles whistle long evenings the old woman without a pile of socks to mend long summer twilight the least of pinetrees takes something from the sky long winter night from the kitchen the sound of drip drip drip long winter shadows frame a patch of sunlight and a sleeping cat look at this fly that long since met eternity his kneeling remains look last nights wind has set the whole garden ablaze with bougainvillea looking away from each other tick of sleet on the car roof looking through spring mist at apple

meditation room the silence is the same reminiscing about alaska the third button of her blouse left wildly undone removing curlers on the way to work the wind in her hair repeatedly wetting my face in the river whirls waiting to get washed rhode island mist a lone figure on the widows walk appears again rhythm of the rakes in a cranberry bog crying of the crickets rhythms of a red shawled girl gathering oysters on the neap tide ripe red apples just over the garden wall the same old hunger rising like birds from the bottom of the canyon the childrens cries river plants floating on the nile

cradle of the moon rooster at sunset above a wisp of cloud a wisp of moon root cellar crock under a skin of dark mold crisp white sauerkraut rough hands the woman i just met i wonder what she does round and round a hawk in the autumn sky the jagged rocks route  curves west an arrow piercing the bleeding eye of god row after row of radishes each top shivering in the cool rain row after row of radishes each top shivering in the cool rain running across the sky the first northern light flicker shredding winter night running in the wind children with a scarlet kite the circling seagulls running switch mending pile of clothes in a basket parading torn jeans running the maine coast  miles round cape crozier my pounding heart rusted bones picked clean the old car lies abandoned beside the highway rusty pump fork of an old tree growing around an axe handle sachi sleeping the sound of the trade wind in her caribbean shell sad tombstones with weathered old short stories young men killed in mines salt wind out of the moonless night the sound of the sea same old moon same old dew same old grass same old sadness sanctifying grace a seagull and a jackdaw they kiss in the sky sand the way of the rain as it ran down this embankment sandhill in the path a sudden panic of ants behind the hiker sandy beach painted in colorless lines and curves canvas for the sea saturday morning pheasant tracks in the new snow we linger in bed scanning the mountains with a fresh eye the artist drawing in ridgelines scanning underground the ears of the batfox twist with the termite trails scattered dry leaves the kitten shakes its paw to remove the sound scattering as the felled elm thunders down dry leaves and birds nests schools of swallow diving in and out of bedrock vast blue sea

dead turkeys the tractor curving along rows of sprouting corn first spatter of rain the trickle seemed small until it found the cliffface joined the waterfall the umbrella it is too small to hold up that much sunlight the unblinking eyes of the immobile toad not a breath of wind the undulating dolphin comes up for breath and to return a smile the unwinding snake scuttles under piledup logs sound of scales on wood the walls of the ward darken with every passing cloud of rain the wedding over he listens to her snore and lights another pipe the white robes of the waterfall swirling at my feet i

wind dies down and the grassland slowly sways to a standstill the wind in my face and the scent of wildflowers harley davidson the windchimes in the rain at the same time ringing and dripping the winddriven snow house after house after house fades away to dreams the winter solstice out of the frozen fog the voices of birds the winter wind a piece of old newspaper blows through the graveyard the woman in the bed too far inside the mirror to touch the yacht naiad rocks like a cradle the breeze dries our tears the young girls fingers explore the lacy fibers of a skeleton leaf the young man who hates the air conditioning is eighty years old the young mother stoops to warm the childs mittens between her gloves there in the valley the old mottled sycamore full of white herons these autumn grasses shoot daggers seed through asphalt between my trains tracks these dark trees against the sky but the clouds do not move they re in the kiva no cloud near double rainbow circled sun thin at the elbows this old flannel shirt still warm another autumn things undone not said the huge north does not permit this selfindulgence this ancient pine tree accords mellow flute tones to the autumn wind this clay pot shaped by blind hands i explore the darkness inside this dogwood by the window not a leaf nor snowflake on it this empty mountain the thinning trail you travel is ravelled in mist this frosty morning red persimmons on a tree where crows are cawing this hot starless night the crickets long sudden pause i listen watch this new year morning shreds of firecracker paper scattered in the street this old pine tree sculpted by a thousand storms endures one more this one last kiss before i leave for the war this winter this sound is a test in a mutual exchange of toadstool clouds this summer stillness in the meadow a childs face among the daisies this winter dawn the chirping of a bird or am i dreaming this years jackfruit hang like huge demons green as testicles shadowed dawn

thrills on snowy hills zooming by crumbled tombstones kids on christmas sleds through binoculars i saw the raccoons paw raised against streams of shot through effervescent aspen ruby columbine on the bluff go on and off through puffedup raisins the long wooden spoon sticks out stirring the moon through the bare window a beam of moonlight on my cracked teacup through the curtain moonlight on my mirror steals lines from my face through the iris each step of the cat followed by the next through the ladders ribs the last storm window s dance of light through the moving clouds the sun warms my face old apple orchard through the peephole a prism of morning sun speckles the white wall through the snowy night drift the odor of woodsmoke and childrens voices through the traffics blur winos shoes point to the sun high noon through the window a moonlit candle flickers in a young girls hand through thick crosshatched bars and a crusty screen the calm sunlit park thru dry winter grasses the striped roadrunner picks out fresh spring beetles thrum of a guitar eyes on the gait of a stalking crane thunder gives a clap as evening buck shoots himself across the pavement thundering hoofbeats the distant herds dust across the wide plains at dusk thunderstorm the old dog curled at her feet in the nuns chapel tide running out the old salt points at himself and the sea tiger swallowtails leaving the azure lake flame gold on the fierce wind till the last minute watching the dark funnel from root cellar steps time crumbles like a bite of toffee in a childs pink mouth time for harvesting in this season of famine only dreams are ripe time soon for paper poppies in lapels and that one minute silence times square diner the woman at the end shouts at her demons timidly i step through your painting to leave footprints on the sky tiny crumbs thrown out urging a raven to show but twenty appear tipperary spring scrubbing lichen from the tomb with a wad of grass tired after hiking in the

for more ice cream too many red leaves too many pink sazanquas time for winter rest too subtle to notice anywhere else the yellow of the blackbirds eye toothless beggar watching the boy with his knife at the pumpkins mouth topography of frost fragile wings come and recede on a mountain river tossing a pine cone on the fire a soundburst of forest wind touching the old warriors bodycuts the song of

red summer moon is launched from the trees vultures circling high drying wings above the pines so begins the day waiting for a bus rain gusting along the street a sheltered doorway waiting for my flight the face of a stranger wears her perfume waiting for my flight the face of a stranger wears her perfume waiting for the train a white cat strolls through the red cannas waiting for you i dream of a boat at a rivers mouth waking early watching the sunrise on the day that you must go waking from a dream i stumble in and see your empty pillow waking from a dream sound of dragonfly wings mirrored on silver lake waking on his porch sunrise shimmers the outline of a mourning dove waking up to orange juice and the smell of last nights broccoli walking alone in the dusk of evening rain drops now and then walking his dog on the old country road grey clouds of evening walking in the garden toward the bamboo gates the fragrance of pines walking in the garden toward the bamboo gates the fragrance of pines walking on new snow touching hands with my shadow the dawnempty world walking to work christmas ribbons in the trash the moon turned sideways walking with my wife waves breaking on the rocks below and quarrelling wall of cricket noise is there room to walk this summer night wall strung with barbed wire the sound of a ping pong ball wallet in pocket money stuffed like burrito

the sea waves of winded rain sweep over the flooded street designing its flow waving oak branches brown leaves flutter to the ground freckled autumn lawn we open the picnic basket in a field of daisies lark song we play hide and seek silently without moving nothing else to do we rest where a milkweed lies open silk rising with the wind we rest where a milkweed lies open silk rising with the wind we used to shriek at tag like that unaware it grows dark weak winter light the baglady scattering crumbs in a pool of pigeons welcome ring necks to my garden feed fatten ah pheasant under glass what a funny sight that rainbow riding proudly on the sullen cloud what can they think of to talk away the night autumn crickets what has he done the scarecrow tending corn on a prison farm what is beauty white iris beside the pool shadowed by butterflies yes what is it she feels the soft cleareyed doe standing warily away what is this light that climbs the shelffungi out of the birches wheat stacked in the field his calloused hand touches her empty chair wheatfield heat the straw beak of a crow in a dying ash wheeling the coffin up the walk into the church the broken pavement whenever i come home there is something compassionate in the buddhas face whenever i come home there is something compassionate in the buddhas face where it was cut back the thicket of blackberries thick with blackbirds where railway workmen waved to us last summer dump trucks piling snow where the chainsaw cleared the last huge oaks the whine of yellowjackets while she dips her pen in moonlight i toss on cold sheets while they haggle over the prayer rug one moth soars towards heaven whistling to his dog my neighbors footprints deeper in the new snow white butterfly how lightly it rests on a barb of fence wire white herons walk in the muddy rice paddy at farmers lunch time white lady a butterfly tries it on why isn t it glass white magnolia like a flock of creamy birds about to take flight white noise in the white computer room a vase of red roses white sky at dawn i found a marrow spoon in the estuary white swells come up the rock a flower closes in momentary nights whitehaired lady giggles its my turn to pay smiles at her date who can write haiku with their nose stuffed the way is open whoa whoa boy the plow horse stops patiently at the fields end whooping off they ve never seen the stars that tenderly bathe her whorl of a sea worm bedded in stone surfer picks his wave wide wale tribal scars in distinctive keloid stripes their catclawed faces smile wiggins i call but my cat too has found the full moon wiggins i call but my cat too has found the full moon wild autumn wind the photos of dead relatives askew on the wall wild elderberries hanging heavy in the heat the smell of the creek wild geese returning on a night when others too cross the border willows half effaced my mist of ancient frescoes a few yellow flakes wind and hawk flow in a soundless path the full moon rises wind blows on the road through the reaped field a dumped scarecrow wind flickers the leaves someone in the neighbors house blowing out candles wind howls in the moon of popping trees branches sink in snow wind in the chimney the sleeping cat uncurls to curl up tighter wind in the dovechimes raintaps on the window lull me to sleep wind picks up outside in the dogs eye the cat changes corners wind through the branches gone without leaving a trace the autumn evening windswept lake the call of the loon bounces from wave to wave windblown cherry blossoms a motorcade slowly winds its way through the park window open on a million stars cup dipped soundlessly in the bowl winning the state lottery he still feeds the dog at the table winter afternoon sudden chill as the sun dims sliver like the moon winter beggar only the eyes and the cup his face never moves winter fog all day long a line of seagulls on the ice winter illness past i read the faint graffiti on a school wall winter midnight walk a steady white breathing of me and of stars winter nightfall the bell missing its clapper rings in the hail storm winter rain in the old mans house dust on the grecian vase winter rain back in the bed i slept in as a child winter solstice a snow goose lifts from its shadow towards the light winter storm i say look at the snowdrifts to my empty room winter theatrics light sky sets the stage for dark trees posing leafless winter trekking from a misty valley comes the shriek of a cock winter wind bit by bit the swallows nest crumbles in the barn winter wind screeches i kneel in snow and hold twin newborn lambs winter window network of lines deepening in the womans white face  winter vying for the chair in the sunny window cat and i wintry gales snow falls on the two crows huddled in the pine wintry moon grey of the old dogs muzzle sniffing the mouse trail with candle and evergreen a dancer in flowing robes leads the processional with eyes closed i feel where the snowflakes fall on my tongue with leisure i ll sit in swamijis room under the banyan tree with my fathers scythe i hack away at thistles going to seed with subsiding foam liquid rises in the glass snow on the window with the hedge gone the magnolia goes public through the iron fence wolf tracks leading to the smell of lumber aframe skeleton in snow woman in garden for the second time today she buries her bird wood smoke in the air the old cherry stump capped with snow woods of white silence snowshoeing man following his own path back home woodsmoke rising my soul floats among the stars in the winter night wrapped in his prayer shawl peace to the mind of ayatollah khomeini wrinkling his nose the boy staples the tip of the paper airplane written in blood on the nuclear warhead the names of the dead yellow clothesline empty raw pole in the woods rain drips from clothespins yellow fingers scratch in a bowl of lemondrops for a harsher sweet yellowred fire tongues talk for us between the flights of migrating cranes yes winter is here today the distant hills are sprinkled with snow yesterdays haiku where it fell in the ivy weightless in the wind you came eighty miles passing mountains and the slopes covered with maples you cling to me from the open window the cool morning breeze you may be angels he says and leprosy melted first your wings you stir and murmur on the pillow by our heads suddenly moonlight you azure crystal day the unmined star sapphire dissolved in the sun your black pantyhose take me by surprise change your plans stay home your chair is vacant my eyes are not familiar with the emptiness your cicadas lord leniently you let them clash toy cymbals all day youthtide ebbs and flows nightmares on stilts ratshit in a certain comer zigzagging across the high plains two wild gorses in the lightning storm nam vets wry smile child in the grocery store with a plastic ak in the dark valley one dead among the dying eyes the rising sun  p m i fill the bird feeder for the first winter cardinal a bird half hidden covered by cool autumn grass pecking at its food a black butterfly comes to bathe in the rainbow streaming from my hose a black oak leans against the burnt out cabin leaves falling deep red a blank page of sand at the waters cutting edge the pattern shaping a block from home a pair of rain drops find my haiku notes a breeze through the house and one fly rushes from window to window a brown canyon the only sound in the smog a bulldozer clearing sage a buddhist temple i spend the evening learning a new way to pray a circle of frogs has a morning pow wow big bull speaks first a cock crows and i look out the window the same empty street a cold west wind frays the reed stumps briars catch in the ice a cold wind moaning mist rising from the hillside poppy in the fog a cold winter night fire burned low arid she spoke of gentle things a conch to his ear the citykid hears distant rumbles of the el a crow flies down to land in the new snow its voice ringing a crow in the air gives scare to the farmer puts out scarecrow a cup of coffee and fog two thousand feet deep at an overlook a dead butterfly held in my wrinkled hand plum leaves on the ground a dim afternoon only trees move in the breeze in the park playground a donkey cart in the middle of the road brimmed with bracken scent a dried corncob on a string in the outhouse webbed to the wall a drop of two of rain as suddenly the mocking bird shuts up a drying north wind all this windmill draws up is its creaking sound a fern in the crack of last years lava flow and its spider a few broken lines in the clouds all thats left of the mountains a few ducks dive  bob slowly toward shore last light of evening a fine dust blowing at site of old potters field gray bones uncovered a first mating call the lonely yelp after dark april at the prowl a flicker of light in the dirty dishwater    winter moon a flock of starlings black against the winter sky the snow is drifting a forgotten ball the moon is washed into shore on wave after wave a gentle rainfall drop by drop my garden rolls down the window pane a glassy calm raindrops carve holes in the sand and in the sea a green heron screech and white lace of excrement falling down the air a group of sparrow loudly chattering together the gossip must be good today a highrise has grown in the old apple orchard smell the spring blooms a hungry field mouse feasting on the sandwich discarded in the school yard a japanese swallow probing up and down a pine stump clouds scud overhead a katydid wheezes its two dry notes out of tune ten million years a lamp is turned on waking from a dream a neighbor drinks tea a leafless oak stands over this winters courtroom my eyes meet the wind a leap to light across the face of the moon a rabbits shadow a light wind bends the hollyhocks birds sun everything i might have dreamed a lily face to face with deaths flower my head under its wing a little sparrow come over here come over here snow is falling there a little warbler sings by the clear mountain stream breeze among green leaves a lizard inching with the shadow of the stone nearer the caves mouth a lone horse and rider move across a snowy field two breaths rising a long winter night listening to the mouse gnaw the thin plywood wall a lull in the storm scent of wild honeysuckle mingles with the rain a midwinter day blue and bright outside till you re out the door a mornings climb and the snail comes to a stop on buddhas smile a mountain pool the trout and its shadow dart from shade to shade a mushroom pushes through the ground frost half moon in a pale sky a new patch of weeds the old road uncertain where it should end a patch of blue sky over the prison compound crisscrossed by jet trails a pressed rose in shakespeare petals fall when moved to new silent sessions a puzzle of bugs scramble across my windshield will they cling wipe out a quiet afternoon the old turtle is drying out beside the still water a ray of spring light in the secret compartment of my old wallet a red shaft of light dances on your moist eyelids the searing morning a roach from colom bia has enough legs and walks the ocean back a robe blows open silk lining the maple leaves on their silver side a rook in a nave of light the weave of a night river a seal rolls up out of the cold bay water we exchange glances a shirt with checks just like the one he wore my dead husband a side street tired of job hunting i pick a sackful of mulberries a small boy barefoot followed by his father one thong on each hand a small brown bunny snuggles at the breast of leaf heaving july sighs a spring rain shoes mud at the front door of a newbuilt house a street musician shelters his harp with pink plastic and goes on playing a summer of grace passing soon in this place of the long rainbow a sweet smelling wind ruffling the crisp golden leaves of last years broccoli a trickling brook burdock blooms and a bent straw bring me home again a turn in the path these puddles reflect only crowns of the pines a warm spring night the shed filled with bleating of the new lambs a warm winter day sudden chill as the sun sets into neighbors tree a wingcrippled goose remains in the marsh its calls echoed by the hills a wooden cask brims with water from a bamboo trough crepe myrtle redden a young raccoon clinging to the cherry tree a blossom in his mouth abed on sunday pulse of traffic in the street a far surf rolling above the crumbled bricks a butterfly its heart attached here to the slums above the green leaves one petal of the white rose gradually going brown absent all summer old tom is sleeping it off under the back porch abundant as sparrows thats what my wife says of the blue herons here across the pasture silences blow their way to me on yellows of mustard across the stone fence the fields fragrant strawberries stooped shirts dark with sweat from shadow to shadow the rabbit hops in moonlight clouds come and go after she leaves her handful of hawkweed flowers keep part of her here after the blizzard a sparrow searches for seeds in the thin cold light after the country church sermon a woolworth penlight beam shows me the way after the grey rain snap of split pine in campfire the forest silence after the gunshot that killed the crippled horse the crows caw and caw windblown maple leaves strewn in heaps upon the path crunch beneath my feet against the night sky a water tower in flames firemen on the roof alas a dead tree but dancing in the spring breeze is a butterfly alas now i have ring around my collar and ring around my waist almost my birthday six inches of fresh snow fell while i was asleep alone in her house a bookcase falls on sophies leg the cat meows alone on a journey the cry of a hawk heard through falling snow along corn stubble in the snowy field the stealthy line of fox prints already its fall how tall my daughter seems now next to the maple already yellow edged the pages of the magazine my last haiku was in always calming now an ease even to grief my koi and goldfish friends always do we know the barren cherry trees burst blossoms in the spring always in twos the nuns dark habits gliding down rue de saint paul amid buzzing flies in the tumbling glacial stream i bathe my tired feet amid the peeps two robins volubly warble we re parents we re parents among the corn rows now and then a tail appears field mice burrowing among the hasidim clapping his hands a man in a silk yellow shirt an august farewell clouds pour forth a final fling spitting out their guts an early spring thaw basement covered with water with some frogs in it an empty street at dawn bare trees are first to receive the morning an old fiddlestick on the dusty attic floor the squeak of a mouse an old man chasing litter in the village street the chill of autumn and a miraculous strange bird shrieks at us and something more and more and as you leave the crystal vase clutches the red of your scarf and no night visitors this past night no black tiger to wave away and while no one is looking a catalpa leaf falls in the forest around the park balloons try to rid themselves of children and be off arrogant raindrops don t take kindly to the road they march march away art and warmth arrange music heard but once drops of stone and water as far toward the trees as the wire mesh gives the foxs nose as i look back your mountain home nearly lost in the wild azaleas as i read the tao some unseen bird is weaving a beautiful song as if shocked the squirrel on the high wire stops then runs on as the mimosa leaf folds the dust is blown into an empty bowl as the month ends the line at the soup kitchen longer every day as the train pulls out a child flattening her nose against the window as they carried him they must have passed the tulip the wooden coffin ashamed to alarm them but juncos fly up with such a tinkling trill asleep on the bus sunlight is carried crosstown on the old mans face at daybreak we walked into the crisp air and watched the golden sunrise nine paper doors the roof tiles so heavy rain drops in the pond at our old camp site a childs running shoe mildews in tall grasses becoming a part of every haiku i read the sound of the sea at the buddhas shrine she offers springs first blossoms hands gnarled and wizened at the edge of a cliff the shakuhachi player bows to the falls at the flower stall breaking stride to take just one whiff of lilac at the foot of the mountain hearing the gravel crunch beneath our feet at the noh play a woman follows her text dirt under her nails at the rivers edge silver flash of a salmon in the bears jaws at the saints statue her small fingers reaching out for the stone lily at the side of the road white flea collar on a dead cat at the streams edge a boy in red galoshes tadpoles with black legs at the street corner shadows of leaves turning red upon the stop sign at the top of the tree one apple the biggest of the lot atop the gold coffin one drop of holy water holds the hot sun august heat where is the old frog pond where are the frog sounds august heat shimmers small toad follows the shadow of the old tree stump old photographs how i long to know my parents before i was born autumn evening chill the sound of a joggers shoes on the gravel road autumn morning cactus blooming on the window sill i m still in bed autumn sunset blue shadows on the mountain meet blue shadows on the lake autumns full moon on the far side of the church the blackest shadows aware of my breasts movement under this thin saffron robe his eyes follow awash and away with snow ice and rotten clumps happy new year rain away from it all already the spiders web strung from tree to car baby just born i m giving you everything that money can t buy back from the sea walk dropping a hermit crabs shell into buddhas hands balcony of the louvre rising from the mowers blade the fragrance of grass balcony of the louvre rising from the mowers blade the fragrance of grass balmy day of spring a love song on the radio ghost of memory bath salts tabasco clorox why do i always pour more than i want bathing i think of you and lift the straw blind to the rain beads of morning dew caught in the spiders web the fly wiggles free bean sprouts and sake how we laughed at dinner peony in a glass because of my joy the washing machine has a long drink of water becoming night a man in a motel room sits shirtless on a bed before dawn the soft sound an oar parts the lotuses the bulbuls song before his father and mother die he will not eat brains tamang way before the ears hear a drumming touches the heart partridge in the woods before the service in the room with the coffin the clock ticking on before the whale comes a trail of flat water across the wave chop before the womb i stand with the hunting sky eye of an owl behind a post the blind guitarist hid from me  southern night air behind the funeral home the chauffeurs loosen their ties and light up cigarettes below the feeder tiny cracks in the sidewalk and new sprigs of breen below zero but this week the sun shines right on the kitchen table bending in the breeze the flowers bow and curtsy to the stately oak beneath the birdbath on summer days my cat sleeps with one eye open beneath the sidewalk the roots of the linden lift my dead brothers name beside the highway pumpkins piled in a wooden cart and an old woman between air and stone and smoke and ice one small laugh is heard between piles of snow the gravediggers work slowly bare oaks and green pines beyond the dust motes a scythe hung on a nail comes into focus beyond the locked gate trees and stones in the moonlight shadow each other beyond the old pond the windows of the condo mirror the autumn moon bird singing in the dark i try to get out of my dream bits of glass tumbled smooth in the ocean clank in the clothes dryer black clouds roll in on the dunes a caterpillar burrows in the grass black ducks tip and preen in the moonlit pond painted on my screen black ice two fawns and a doe gnawing holes in the old pasture black limb of the pine holding a stellers jay again the blue sky blank windows next door surprised to miss the neighbor i didn t like blind girls cigarette i try to direct her match under her jittering eye blizzard is here now her freezing hand is here too farmyards are empty blood on its talons the hawk preens its feathers rain on the lake blowing out the match the rooms engulfed in darkness clouds unveil the moon blown spume on the lake cloud wisps join and separate these two dragonflies blue jays chattering in my tree of what mischief do you proudly scream blue ribbon awards on the hides of the horses hot sun rays glitter bob cratchit giggles thinking scrooge will give him a day off bah humbug breakfast toast alone a few brown leaves fall in patches of autumn sun breakfast toast alone a few brown leaves fall in patches of autumn sun breathing out i give back to the wind what it has given me bright august morning dew and a small gray feather on a spiders web bright umbrella tops glide along the fieldstone wall the first warm spring rain brought by the wind these tiny seeds have sprouted some big black crows buds swell a child crawls toward the tapping of the old mans cane bull durham sack string from denim jacket pocket blows with the west wind bullfrog in twilight parting the ponds weeds with the full moon rising green bus stop snow recalling the haiku one blossom one blossoms worth of warmth

path to the pond i hold your hand country heat wave the tarred road to the graveyard stick to my feet cracks in porcelain in the bright eye of morning swan turns into goose cries from the crib we both wait to see who will get up crossing cedar lake high up long bars of clouds race us to sundown crossing the finish line her crimson running shirt wet with sweat  tears crossing the street old lady with a cane maple leaf in the wind a black and white dog sniffs gravestone to gravestone pees on hoosier poet crows in the corn stubble their croaking sounds get stuck in my ear cry of a seagull swooping low over factories the band starts at nine curled up soft and white wreathed in pretty roadside leaves some dead animal cutting weeds all afternoon the fragrance caught in the cuffs of my jeans dark december sky i watch my breath becoming one with mists of night dark of the moon wind in the eyes searching for the lost pleiad dark rainclouds in the east the crying of the seagulls in the harbour darker than the sky this room even the fir trees a single star dawn breaks across the scallop shell rays of orange spread outward to white dawn in a strange bed birds singing whose names i have never learned dawn light the flower halfway up the cliff still tossing in the wind day after the storm blackbirds on branches shaking down dust of spring snow days grow cold and dim dewdrops linger autumn leaves golden age you call deep in the outfield the long high fly disappears against the full moon deep in the thicket the cords of winter slacken in the sparrows throat deeper in the mud at the cemetery gate the tracks of the hearse dew on the wild roses dew on the shabby nettles still simply dew dipping my finger in the holy water font the first day of spring distant city lights and here between the fireflies stars in the old pond do you move slowly because you need time to think thinking is chancy don t mow the grass yet let the dandelions live a little longer dormant buds a woman beats her dust mop against an old brick wall down alleys winding and dark a soldier leads us to a working church down at melbourne beach a soggy slice of lemon an empty tea cup down by the bayou through gray hanging moss the sound of a snipe down from the hillside a rush and spill of jonquils flooding the meadow down the dark steps the silver tray we never used flashes its light down the snowy hillside the sun comes one stone step at a time draft registration a shirtless youth in blue jeans waits for the old clerk drawn into their light as though the sun lived only in the daffodils drawn into their light as though the sun lived only in the daffodils dreaming of scissors that cut my shadow into the shape of the elm dreaming of swimming swimming and dreaming i return in my dreams

shadow of the bridge drifting maple leaves click clack of passing freight cars fill the empty sty drinking from the stream petals of the mountain plum fall now and again drinking ginseng tea its

circus tent from the high wire a spider swings on its thread empty meat market an old sheet of fly paper holds a winter fly end of summer at last the wild rams take pellets from his hand ending of summer a blurred red moon stains the sea a bleeding thumbnail endless waiting in the heat the right bus pulls away filled with strangers even bike riding this morning is different up late last night with basho even in the shade a silver fire keeps flashing from the soldiers blade even in this fog the waves keep slapping the shore wherever it is even more delicious these plums and my lovers

shadows fill the footprints across the sand dunes the august winds of shanghai blast through the bund theres no state control the awakening moon every part of this earth is sacred to my people the bell still silent in the hall outside the front door footsteps hesitate the bells are silent at this church now only the wrecking ball swings the bent cedar clings on the windswept rocky ledge high above the lake the birds are gone the scarecrow stands in snow leaning on the moon the boy is looking at the procession of ants hes an only child the bridge tollbooth from the dark a hand collects rain on the coins the brimshadow of the fat mans straw hat lowers over a long sandwich the candlelight enlarges the dark shadows of the toy dog a boy shivers the cat asleep but for the tip of her tail

a wood thrush comes for a drink the cry of geese  follow my sons footprints across the ground frost the dark small herb shop has dusty shelves of boxes cures for everything the day has twentyfour hours no more no less the night is imposed the day now longer my wife raises the hem of her new dress the deep richness of torah with gospels joyful highs music for the dance the delicate leaf hangs on in blustery wind ice cracks on the pond the depths of winter only dry leaves and flowers climbing up the walls the domed roof of the round house shaker barn a mandala of timber the dragons abide he thinks the rain and thunder might make them appear the drifting feather is not the flock its shadow is not the falcon the empty room the thin white band of flesh on his ring finger the end of my lane i open the sagging gate to autumn sunset the fallen petals mingle with the smooth stones we picked at the beach the family gathered a tear of embalming fluid runs from my brothers eye the far cicada fading in the heat and haze daisies at my feet the far dinner gong mingling with the sound of scythes the meadowlarks song the fat haws ripen dusky dew on the rose leaves under hazy skies the fat woman cries as the hearse drives away then powders her face the fishmongers truck a black pickup at the curb between humps of ice the gallerys dark one spotlight finds your dead face smiling from the wall the garden at dawn the whiteness of peonies that fell in the night the gentle deer tracks run off toward the western hill chasing falls rainbow the glittering marquee goes dark a cattle truck waits to make a turn the great bell sounds the courtyard falls quiet in a still deep water the grey cranes at dusk bending in a line along the crooked fenceposts the gulls steep rise its sharp shadows on the sand loses its focus the handful of rose petals you threw in my bath clogging the drain the handle gone the teacup still in use and plum blossoms coming on the heat of the day forgotten with the arrival of a stray dog the hickory nut out of its husk in the hand is itself again the honeybee stays so long in the foxglove a cloud over the sun the hoot of an owl and the night wind comes on october evening the hummingbird called to its golgotha of air all that faith in glue the lake disappears into the fog but one crow flaps his way clear no grace before they dine but always the ritual of pouring the wine the last red apple that clung through autumn winds gone from the branch the light on my fathers face as he bends to fill his bowl the little barn owl sitting on the pine branch he gives a hoot the little girl screams in the cool night meadow two amber eyes shine the logger picks his way through the woods but stays in the sun the long bitter search at last the prospector turns from his partners grave the looking glass pond distant mist marries the marsh to the croaking frogs the magpie screams out while stealing its daily meal too proudly i think the maple leaves falls a thick carpet of crimson covers the new grave the marsh after rain wading step by silent step a great blue heron the master of all is time the universal ticker like a stubborn wall the swollen moon looms over seas of purple mist parted do we watch the monastery wall so cool on our backs we talk of the heat the moon follows me goes with me into my house taking my pillow the moon is rising wild lines of lightning leap from the western clouds the moon just risen a flock of birds flies home to roosevelt island the moon decreasing looks so pregnant ice pierces the sun golds so slow the moon s a perfect fairy tale quarter steam lifts from my cup the moonlight twice shaded i walk under the pine then under the owl the morning bustle at a florist s the sound of watering cascade chrysanthemums the neglected yard   now the lilies are blooming amid blackberry vines the neighbors parrot that used to chatter all day has learned to whistle the new year begins tinsel strewn on the path glitters in the sun the nightingale is not much on daylight the darker the better he sings the office building empties wave after wave of crows in the fading light the old aunts will everything to my niece if she has found herself leafy swamp hummock the old cajun mixes the mash for his moonshine still bird chatter at dawn the old cajuns pirogue beached beside the widows shack the old cat yawns just a few stars blinking above the young corn the old covered bridge swept away by the flash flood pigeon nest adrift the old ducklady tossing stale bread on the shore pockets the last piece the old farm road snow in the wagon ruts swirls around and around the old fisherman at dusk bends low in his boat two vultures screeching the old red barn leans into the golden broomstraw creaking with the wind the old river of my childhood still rushing over the dam in spring the old rooster dies and the faraway fox barks in the cold darkness the one tall thistle in a field of winter wheat and its meadowlark the orchard is ripe an orange drops into dusk against the autumn sky the oregon trail where it winds around the bluff sits a clouds shadows the outline of an island not visited since childhood spray over the bow the pauses within robins song to the dawn are long draughts of dew the peak of the drought a blizzard of butterflies blankets the dry creek the plants in the yard at night i find them entering my dreams the poem will begin after the words are spoken ripples on the pond the pond is silent a duck swims in the moonlight gentle rain begins the power lines make a net to catch the moon for an instant the radio plays another damn love song all the junk in my room the red azaleas in landscaped gardens all night grow wild in my lungs the resthome van toothless old faces smile as a fire truck races past the river of spring the ebb and flow of sunshine chills my toes the roar of a jet fades in the gray morning a dream remnant the rocks thick with ice the sea all motherofpearl in the golden dawn the sail is luffing i sit watching its reflection on my wedding ring the scarecrow gone just his gloves hung upside down on stiff okra stalks the sea darkens divers come up from the wreck with the days booty the season begins under the half finished deck a birds nest with eggs the shadow of my hand goes down to where the fish can feel the shadow of the cypress almost touches the far side of the bayou the shape of a lotus ironwrought window grill frames the sky of mayapura the shriek of an owl under her reading glass even the print quivers the shrill of crickets a shadow of coolness cast by the circling fan the small waterfall once more falls through bare branches into as wrinkled sky the sound of a bell in the plush of summer dusk soft indentations the sound of thaw in the drain we both start to speak first the sound of the falls the sound of the pool a salmon leaps the spice sellers stall has saucers of bright powders strange seeds and berries the spider suspends her web in the empty eye socket of the skull the spring has gone spoken with lips and eyes as she turned away the spring that lost its identity in the rain is a song again the steeple cross stands in a burst of light in the morning sun the steeple cross stands in a burst of light in the morning sun the stream in summer i stick my feet in help i m falling the student lamp of the scholar next door keeps time with the stars the summer lake from this hill through these grasses a beetles eye view the sun goes behind the one cloud in the sky my winter morning the sun itching on cuts of water reeds the crackle of dragonfly wings the sun itching on cuts of water reeds the crackle of dragonfly wings the sun slips low a carnelian red paving the water with dark light the tinkle of chimes mingles with the steady fall of the autumn rain the toll of the bells my father with salttipped wings seagulls wheeling scream the tree toads talk rustles through the ferns a snake sheds skin  the village graveyard one by one the headstones lost in the ocean mist the village waiting turquoise chips and blessed corn meal scattered on the snow the wake of the boat trolling past our pier ripples in my tea the warmth of the day pierces me the legless man sunning his stumps the waves charge and crash then they return again and again and again the way silence waits and waits for the next cry of the loon the weedblocked path and apples left to the worms chimneys to the birds the whalers long gone two blue whales spouting water spring in lahahina sea the whistling swans recede their sheer whiteness gleaming far down the spring sky the whole world fits in to seventeen syllables and you in this hut the wind along the old railroad tracks a milkweed pod opens   the wind comes to visit and shifting sand moves over covering my stone the winter moon when i come to think of it nothing between us the winter waves make thunder as they peak and shatter along the shore the woods floor so brown last week is carpeted with yellow leaves today the young go hatless the old smile remembering the wind in their hair there is no return nothing is ever the same the river flows on there was no other in the wisdom of the night but the owl theres the double il lusion each believing hes en slaved by the other these fallen leaves the kitten pauses to shake each sound from its paws these new wind chimes take a bit more breeze than the old ones they come and they go through the cemetery gate cold wind and snow thin white curtains full of the rain smell and the noise of leaves third snowfall of the long freeze the last grape hangs on the vine thirties whatnot dog between its paws the bright ball of my childhood heart this babe sucking milk rolls her eyes in ecstacy how little she knows this bed an room every time we come back the days light fades this business of skunk crossing an autumn main road nose to the grindstone this damp spring night lightning cracks through dense clouds the first peeper calls this great harvest moon comes orange from the wheat field noisy starlings roost this hot summer day a mongoose crosses the road fades into dry weeds this new years day too the shadows of crows course over the snow this old chinese ring slipped from a lepers finger or so grandpa said those wading herons dark blue in the autumn eve quickly speak the fish through broken skylight in the roof of the old barn obelisk of light through candy wrappers and pumpkin shards in the street a black cat crossing through my side vision people moving to and fro leaves in the wind through the cracked windows a slanted beam of sunlight makes floating dust glow through the early mist no sound from the fisherman on the other bank through the hole in the snow the face of the dead field mouse through the leaky roof of the old covered bridge rays of lantern light through the old mans night a flight of departing geese increases the cold through the open window dogs howl to a sirens wail midnight summer moon through the tall grasses stealthily stalks my tame cat she does not forget through the window of his white rolls royce i slip a wild rose through the windy streets only the salvation army man s lone trumpet call through the windy streets only the salvation army man s lone trumpet call through tops of pines a man walking his dog at the seas edge throughout the winter this floor vent blowing warm air and a budgies song thunder in the skin scent we open the curtains to watch the rain thunder leaves its voice rolling along cloud bottoms rain wipes earth face clean till late in the evening crickets cry and cry in the dark grass time for the postman the widow across the street sweeps her porch again to cross her pillow along strands of hair so long for these eyes to the last firefly the light in the stone lantern has gone out toast with two sides my wife eats one i wait for the other tonight the one star fashions like all the others but brighter so near too close the welder hums too far no spark learning to write haiku too long winters siege  in turning from snowfall the first snowpea sprouts above her paper boat the blind girls lighted face floats in the dusk touching her small hands pain of her harsh journey plumes away like smoke touching the cocoon a girl with dark red polish on her bitten nails toy shop window one of the brave tin soldiers has fallen in battle traffic stopped the paper lady puts her foot down on the moving van train starts to move the rain on the window slants the other way trees become shorter as thirdday snow builds higher clouds just smile and sneeze trees in the dark night sway peacefully in the wind whispering to me tubs and water pails the currants are richly black just right for jelly tulip tree in bloom taken right out of my mouth the robins words tulips thru the snow a girl in a parka passes the empty billboard tuneups alignments a sparrows nest in each n three pair not just one turned insideout by the storm she lets the wind take her ruined umbrella turning my head back suddenly the setting sun is on the grave mound turning the shed knob a mayfly slips in first out of the rain soft silver moonbeams gently touch the rolling waves a breeze of silk stirs twisted mangrove root from a dark crevice the eyes of some small creature two bright eyes watch me beneath the strawberry leaves looooong body slips out two frogs found sunshine leaping through the morning mist buddies side by side two grocery carts neatly full of all she owns last years smile stolen two jade beads and a heart of agate purchases from the street display along the great stream watch the stagnant pools scum slime and slow death two rams colliding silently on a far slope then the crack of sound two small sparrows struggling for a piece of bread too big to carry two weeks without rain the heron is six inches taller in the swamp ulysses is out a snail sleeps on a lily murmuring i m out under the blossoms he forgets he exists theres only the moon and wine under the maple a cluster of sleepy cows swap flies with their tails under the red maple the smell of your love still on my hands under the summer sun in the old ladys backyard red tea roses bloom under the table where everyone can see we touch hand to burning hand unfelt a faint breeze makes leaf shadows dance lightly on my bare arm unfurling to light and what a long way to go the seedling oak unnoticed a dog sneaks a tulip bulb and tears off down the street up in the linden mingling with the summer wind whispers from the treehouse up the slope of the hill a border of daylilies follows the path faces bigger than life greet the dawn man faces for the dead boys vines of bittersweet a gold husk has folded back from a red berry vishnu says that cats cover their shit so the tiger cannot find it voices of sparrows deep in the snowcrusted ivy on the barns stone wall waiting and folded deep into this cold month the rich hearts of tulips waiting for the woman with cherries on her hat sparrows in the snow waiting out a gust to move one foot forward on the glazed walk waking from a dream the newspaper hits the porch with a dull thud waking up to sound of rain outside the window going back to sleep walking in the dark the nearness of yellow leaves and dark far beyond walking in the park rainclouds shield us from the sun showers of petals walking summer sand with you again love we leave one row of footprints warmth of clay bowl fragrance of miso steam first rain of the year watching snow fall in the nite i have a thousand questions for shiki watching the ball game livening up the sports day a childrens frog race watching the traffic she sings an old enka song sports park leaves turning waves rushing to shore bearing flotsam and jetsam as gifts from the sea wax candle in bloom the pregnant cat licks the fur from her nipples we enter our new home where their pictures hung the wallpaper is brighter we spoke with our hands jumpstarting the french girls car the summer rain we stand parting the winter wind whips my words back into my face we watch the stars the twinkling glow from our joint merging with fireflies weakened after storms a strong wind slammed the door shut crumbling steps shattered web wire fence the antlers of a dead buck point toward the woods weeds going to seed around the pond and footbridge the small stone buddha weeds going to seed around the pond and footbridge the small stone buddha weeds going to seed around the pond and footbridge the small stone buddha weeds up to my hips an old graveyard abandoned by all who could weeping cherry wand forced in the kitchen begins to bud the cats eyes what a good progress a new wheat reaping machine driven by a woman what am i dreaming of nothing i m creating the dream heavy soul what bites the end off swallows itself has no tail six letters across what can it be that swims the wild ducks flies the sea birds what is lovelier than this glass of cherry pop in the summer light what is lovelier than this glass of cherry pop in the summer light deep down something told me with the coming of spring it would grow when i raised my face from between her thighs it was already dark where

white sand and palms jogging in the cool sea breeze mile after mile why don t you read the first  syllables of your long poem wild carrot in bloom wavers whitely in the heat old cats dry cough wild geese flying south shadows that cross the moonlight cross the water too willows edge the bank a white heron picks its way through their reflections wind turning the yellow pages of telephone directory

alzo los ojos no hay nada silencio sobre la rama sobre la rama quebrada am i having fun gasping up this steep couloir in the wind and snow amid springtime leaves the sound of the brook and wind grain of sand mountain amid the sharp rocks the minnows move in and out with the swift current among the poplars in a sudden stir of wind a white owl cries out an april shower strikes the greenhouse where our love affair drags on and on an armadillo but we re not in mexico the old recap on the road an old and green pond you search the reeds for a frog suddenly silent an old man lingers coffee cup in weathered hand and looks to the sea an old woman sits hands busy latching a rug mouth moving with the hook an uncle home on furlough eyes straight ahead lips tight jaw tilted just so an unfurling leaf the sun prints it on the stone that holds the buddha and always in twos the nuns dark habits gliding down rue de saint paul and make the branches of pines loud with the silent movement of their wings and the pears we waited for ripening too late by a too thin sun and the ship pulls up the rusty anchor and the anchor a rusty moon and we re all waiting for that damn splashing frog to jump out again ant paused on peach pit how to take this treasure home to the family arms filled with gifts i am unable to wave goodbye so i bow instead as gold green brown whip past wind torn turn paper birch heron wings slowly as her mother kneels a brighteyed baby pulls at flowers beside the saints statue as i return home i gaze up into the sky a line of geese as if searching for the ocean wrapped in glad bags seagulls at the dump as night draws closer fuji blushes a deep rose and sinks in his arms as the gathered poets take turns reading the cat purrs from lap to lap as though coming right back her glasses and a rose left on her book as we draw nearer i can feel the great distance that attracts us so as with my father now in my mothers sickroom the smell of old age ashes to ashes    a maple seed spins into her open grave ashes to ashes    her twoyear old kicks the moist black earth ashes to ashes    her unironed blouse still drapes the empty chair at an old mans knee a small boy with long hair is that i at last the first star and in the duskdark house the phone is ringing at my typewriter i ask her to be still she will be grown soon at the height of a snowstorm white flakes on the pine meltdrops along wire at the poetry reading the loose strap on your white dress and falling rain attracted to you before i know you can t you pluck me one rose autumn wind hisses in the leaves hisses in the grass sound of distant faucet baby on the way two feet are out said krishna baby is a calf bedded in bright leaves the combs she lost last summer soon winter will come begin a whisper when the dream begins to scream make the words its done belonging to the flowers in that room of flowers not a word about father beneath the rainy oak an old man swigs a brown bag full of yesterdays between house and tree a single strand of cobweb twists now red now green between the fire bells and the buckets of water the frog in the well between the mountains a path leads to the sun climbing into the morning sky beyond my back door a black cat sits crying rain fills the evening sky beyond the green shrubs ducks drop out of the clear sky seven water rings birds at the surfs edge pecking something in the foam jumping now and then bitchy halloween makes the brush and trees of earth to burn with the wind bitter cold thread by thread a peacock spreads its tail on the weavers loom blade of grass stooping under the burden of rain drop on its weary back bleak and weary night arms bent against foul monsters a faint chirp dawns light blue flower coming and it blooms just because it s morning theres no sun bluegrey horizon mud cakes crack in the warm sun clams squeeze their shells tight bored by my yoga an old cat with halfclosed eyes licks clean his loins boys in the garden larger berates smaller whose voice is a wild girl s breakers energies spent on the shores with this pledge next time next time next brushing at the darkness on the table she tells me she has a lover bus stop snow no new gloves but two weeks of getting round to it by our mountain lake pines reach up in evening skies swaying with the stars by the muddy bank light ripples in the water grain in an old board by the oil lamps soft yellow the carvers stool in a bed of chips by the pasture fence snow piles up in a high drift over the haystack by the roadside grew a rose of sharon my horse has just eaten it by the willow tree a young girl in a lace veil the summer breeze calfs hunger at dawn in my dream i awake in the old dairy barn calling grave figures deafened by the grief of death the song that is spring carries the snags the leaves carries the rocks home carries what we leave it caught on the rise arms and legs in a flurry stopped by the mat chalk circle on the sidewalk a game of marbles and laughter of the children chestnut blossoms and in the park two filles de joie watch the children play chinese new year the full moon in the fountain still caught in the trees cicadas   i spit on a piece of slate and hone my knife circling higher and higher at last the hawk pulls its shadow from the world clean summer breeze the curtain as far out the window as it will go cleaning the luger he took from a dead german old man starts to cry clothes strung on the line hang themselves for being soiled during length of time cobwebs wrap my face first on the trail this morning i open woods door cold winds rattle my window in the early morning the sound of falling leaves coming in dewed with fog and the smell of night air the ginger cat coming in to land in the bay silver waves lap the small dark islands creeks perk like coffee strong steady till all tug hill smells rich heavy mud crossing the bridge wild geese cry through a mist that dimly veils the dawn crosslegged for an hour i can t feel my feet a monk swallows kerplunk cutting up onions for the man who loved onions a tear on the plate darkness overtakes the old man painting his house the color of the evening sky dawn on the prairie a hare has drawn the eagle down from its aerie deer study the wind then bound through the dry brush with scarcely a sound distinguished grey elm you tower above the swamp yet some say you are dead don t be sad my love this crimson maple leaf is not for you down the rain street a wagon rattling its dented roof covered with cherry petals drawn the suns magnet returned the pavements chalk kite fields through me to blue dust from the ore tailings a flash of tanager wings in the hot sun early morning the yellow tulip in the white vase holds a cup of sun elbows on the bridge the children discuss the flow and the towns old men empty house lights out lonely then he recalls bon nie has gone to pot end of the old pier a dead flounders eye stares at the autumn moon says without the sweat in the sun you cannot enjoy the cooling of leaves etched against the mist stands the nearest walnut tree the rest wait off stage except for the wind the leaf i suppose would be still as the rock expecting her back soon i left the night stand light dawn had two colors expecting me soon she combs her tangled hair i ll only muss it up factory smoke turns cold fuming droplets from and fall the white snow is stained falling into dusk my legs wrapped around him the moon rises in his eyes first dim light of day the sound of soft kona rain in kukui trees first snow the old farmer pulls up on his skidoo to watch stalled traffic first snow of the year racing barefoot to the box for last years mail fishing the bayou old cajun lays down her pole for a dip of snuff flecked with sun and ice the creek cascades from winter woods redwing blackbirds song fleeting into my dreams what once was is now will be which is fantasy fly bee mosquito take me to your land of jazz june pays bloody well flying into my room a bat crashes against the lamp scattered cracks of light fog before dawn i dream of being an infant and hug you from sleep fool i was to pick them i remember the place now three flowers less for a moment a bright leaf and a sparrow sway in the bare bush for an orchard fence with summer in the treetops white paint is the best for the eightythird time a car salesman tells how he was wounded at inchon for the sick man all of sky and earth is loud an autumn cicada for the smell i plane another shaving snow buries my tracks from the house forty swollen cows crowd their way through autumns field toward the old stone fence four months in bed how is it they are obscene out of season flowers fourth week of august a single goldenrod in tall grass the whole world yellow fresh from the dirt human bones and pig bones into the same finds tray fresh plowed earth lying in the shade of a wall three girls in jeans from a granite cliff letting wind take his ashes some blow back to me from far away i have come to this new garden the heart of heaven from out of the mist the wind blows an eagles cry across the valley from the village square old cronies leaving one by one in the evening sun from under the mask floating in the rain puddle the face of the moon frost on the pumpkins two geese flying side by side away from the sun full winter moon this dead tree and i are made to share a shadow gee haw giddap the old plow horse moves as one with the farmers voice grass touching a tree the mountain touching a river while i touch them all a round morning moon the sawyer makes more snow fall in the old orchard a slender finger of light pokes a golden finger in the bare back stage my body is full it whistles a cool attack but not with your noise your love was a port of call where many ships docked until morning came your love was a port of call where many ships docked until morning came drops of autumn rain fall like petals of blue flame through a painless window the woman has spring in her hair the man has spring in his murmuring half of two ears cheeks of a devils ass i short flap corduroy cap hands crossed in cuffs he turns away from the jury first day of summer having glimpsed its mind i no longer want to kill that same old cockroach he gathers acorns in a drawer of his desk and he does not read he has a luminous face that cowherd he is a son of the moon he holds the hand lens intricate veining all that is left dried cottonwood leaf he makes the sign of the cross shyly teaches me dirty words in spanish he stared at me as i watched him riding a boy on an ass head bent in silent prayer a girl reads les fleurs du mal over baudelaire headlights coming on a crow takes the last sunshine in its beak and feet heat in the stalls somewhere deep in the stable a cow bawls and bawls her hands are wrinkled she keeps them inside her cape as the bus passes her raincoat snares in the turnstile a volume of jung drops at my feet here in die setting sun i see that his feet are encrusted with dirt here on the mountain clouds crumble against the pines fall as drops of dew hey monks ladybugs beat you guys to the shaved head and patched orange robe hiking through dry grass we talk of locust sounds i can no longer hear his third eye haiku folded into my jeans     bleeding blue home on new years eve to avoid all the drinking i drown my boredom the loveliest whore a child in jade and satin walks the wet streets home hours at the loom patiently snapping in place a pattern of knots  dyes how does the moss grow or the grey rocks in the garden of ryoanji huge fish hawk shadow dark upon the lakes children you wing whirl glide to huge wad of snails on a pointed rick hes culled them from the flowerbeds i know this road yet ask my father which way the geese are going i stamp my feet fearing frostbite a boy holds an icecream cone and smiles i stand in the grass weighing a handful of berries a handful of stones i thought i heard indras footsteps but they were the footsteps of the rain i was drawing the lilacs walt when she came out pruning shears in hand i will take a nap in this heavy shower of white mountain cherry petals i would paint a black cloud tied to roots river rock floating on sunlight i wrap myself tight in robes and famous last dreams the woodpile is low i wrote a perfect haiku in last nights dream sunbeam on the blank page i m alone at last the scent of roses blends warmly forgetting deep sleep i m asked to wait drinking mountain spring water from a white paper cup i m attached and hes attached indra of the thousand eyes and one heart i m too old he says she opens winter shutters on the quince bloom ice as far as the eye can see two ravens on a barren branch ice on the pond the barn cat moves her kittens to the hay mow in a niche of the kiva where sacred treasures were stored tiny animal droppings in a red sweatshirt a boy walks past the branches of a leafless bush in an autumn wind looking through a box of books left on the corner in autumn plum trees toss purple leaves to the ground the soft earth blushes in bed we make our cricket shape the old bedsprings sing a cricket song in fathers coffin stopped at the time of his death my dead brothers watch in front of my house the shadow on the linden stretches to the hearse in her dressing room the stripper powders her breasts and whispers something to them in his reprimanding eyes my naked soul and a glimpse of his pure love in his shoes tonight i go out to watch the sky he swore by in its bare branches the young pin oak this year with a squirrel nest in my prison cell i am happy for the worm freed from the walnut in the assertive voice of the aging associate professor i hear the empty box in the august heat i searched for a garden breeze felt my mothers smile in the bent birch tree wind ruffles the fur and quills of a porcupine in the dead of night the sound of running feet from the street below in the dewy morning the whiskers of a dead cat glisten in the sun in the duck pen among corn meal and straw the squeaking of field mice in the early evening my grandson stepping on my shadow and i on his in the empty field a horse eats dried grass wind blows his black mane in the evening light flowers turned black and gray old widow goes to mass in the gray dawn i await the sun and think of the mights lovemaking in the only tall grass left still to mow the mower having his lunch in the padded room he sleeps on the bed mattress on the cold floor in the rising sun the window bars across the floor reach the other wall in the strong sea winds the vulture is swept too high wing tips quivering in the swimming pool a single small frog slips in the shriek of swimmers in the warm night rain the scent of the mango trees my country thailand in the weedgrown orchard an apple falls onto others no one left to hear in this hot breeze the cottonwood by the bluffs has the most to say in this snow squall only the smoke from my pipe refuses to turn white it would have made sense the speeding ticket getting home rather than to work its my sister whos so good at holding the worst of her pain away jogging the jail track who who from an unseen owl and i feel relief just after the sunset the first stars rise in the sky the opal shadows just enough moonlight a curled new leaf on each limb of the young sycamore just in from the rain my wet shaggy dog smells like fifty dry ones knitting mittens with all my heart dislike him a little for his big hands krishna climbed a tree where the roses wind let fall blossoms smelling like soap laid high in the arms of the snowcapped mountain peaks the lake is serene laser rays of sun through holes in the old church cross in floating dust last day of summer returning to the dark house and two stained tea cups last days of winter only the tall of my kite flutters in the oak last sun of the day my long bent shadow across the half spaded garden late night highway the smoke of a single truck whisps through the dark pines late night in the cabin rain sounds on the window stop the quiet deepens laundry on the line heaves a sigh of wet relief now begins the sun leap bright dolphins break with showers of joy into the shrine holy art thou leaving a wake of smoke he runs toward the graves a fist of incense leaving the ridge to racing hikers streaked with sweat the way of the stream leaving viet nam through the august heat and haze his body packed in ice les plus grands bols de la maison si petits dans ce champ de fraises lesbos through the mist and we share our lunch with gulls on orion beach i am holding you in the space between my breasts listening to the rain letup in the rain sloshing out to see how far the flood has risen like moths we danced into the moons white light into the moons white light lilies in the field sing hymns to the lazy sun lips caress the light little cicada how brave to keep up your song while that bird eats you looking down from the pass at the fear left behind a forest of mist loud liquored voices from across the way i count the circles in a stump love you world today tis the season to be jolly what eja bring me low tide this morning not a trace of the castle not even the moat his eczema itch to make the wild winding stream as straight as a ditch the present shall pass and you can see it going in the looking glass martins in the wind moss and the first wild orchids between the grey rocks mending fishing nets the last mesh square at the end the women look up migrant workers rest in a field a bird sings the endless song of summer milkweed gone to seed a striped garter snake glides through the tangled squash vines mirrored image stares back at me then forms the face i show to strangers mist on the mountain around the dead pokeweed stalk a ring of green shoots moonglow through shutters after all our lights are out still too bright for sleep morning from the train a woman hangs her laundry on the edge of town morning noon and night peepers never give up the fight to make themselves heard mossy rocks linked by leaves from overhanging trees give a song to this stream mount rainier came out thats how we say it here the mountains

winter rain red buds falling from the plum tree night wind from the hills the blind coon hound lifts its head and sniffs night wind locked out with rapists waxing moon hidden by street light bad dreams no foot has touched it the only paths across this snow shadows of trees no sheep on the hill only an old shepherd gazing on a buttermilk sky not a pine shivers over blue mist of snowmelt a hawk circles the peak nothing else to do her hand returns to stroke the cat brushing off darkness now ice clouds enscale the mackerel sky mare tails whip blue in white flame o healthy apple tree look at all the apples on you berry branches full of a raven hovering at sundown my grandfather she said he likes to visit old frog is croaking a row of muskrat houses at edge of the slough old green shingled walls the garage with a red roof leans just a little old man and a mule plowing corn in the valley mist on the summit old man on the street stops and spits in the new snow christmas morning old moss and young grass gracing soldiers graves gracing old moss and young grass older and more stubborn i am listening to the bell on new years eve on an early sunday morning tourists meditate in front of an empty city bank on the brisk sea breeze blown back in the captains face the boatswains ashes on the bulldozer the stain of red rose petals and now the old house on the first floor of a  storey office building an immigrant caretaker daydreams on the frozen pane the childs warm breath is a net for the stars on the frozen snow reflecting the rising sun the eyes of the dead doe on the gingko avenue an autumn wind blows a young buddhist priest sweeps hard on the kitchen table the peaches swim in red wine aunts and uncles sing on the milk carton blown about by the cold wind pictures of missing children on the newspaper left in the wake of the hearse dust settles on dust on the peace treaty signed on the sioux reservation the names of the dead on this autumn day i have that let down feeling oops broken bra strap on this chilly night a gray moth in the attic dusts the dolls cheek on time cards at the entrance to the mine the names of the dead once we talked now we don t see each other in the same room one child slings a stone at another in the distance mass and methodist bells my knife goes gliding sweet juice from the pear falls on your japanese poems mind goes to stillness sweet juice forms the pear and falls on japanese poems one kid in the dump just yelled to his playmates look a flying saucer one proud fat cattail palls to aprils roar of flood cutting its own stem onto the snow moor out of the bamboo bushes runs a brown wild boar open sign at the country store summer wind blows through holes in the walls orange and red the sky the trees are a festival the geese are honking our pond is too small for the sleek young pickerel who dream of oceans out from the chimney the ghosts of old apple trees floating toward the moon out of a trash bag a curl of red ribbon falls to the floor partially shrouded by the steam of a hot spring a fawn in the ferns passing her house late one night i see her shadow move across the shade patient you wait but i am gone like a flung stone sinking in water patiently waiting for the pill to ease the pain she hums an old hymn pencils of moonlight write words of love on the walls of my darkened room pent up in old flesh his hands in constant movement fumble for a latch penthouse in dark clouds if i were rich i would see inside the rain petal by petal the white peony peeled open by a swarm of black ants plum blossoms are lost in the dust of roofing work falling drops of tar pouring from a vase i rinse my wifes hair dead roses in the sink pressing up to crack the thin crust on last lights snow red peony shoots pride of the herd the bull with a blue ribbon gets led away too priests chant the sutra the past whirls in my mind at my fathers funeral priests chant the sutra the past whirls in my mind at my fathers funeral puppys silent paws allow him to romp right up to butterflies on the walk putting out my light birches begin to assemble one by one in the dark rain sweeps the dry field a scarecrow flutters and falls beneath the corn rows rats on the rampage rampant in all the tall piles of rubbish and rubble red and pink and blue her wash fragile on the line between ancient trees red walls and towers above mornings bed of snow smiles from a mink cap riding snout out with eyes closed by the wind in a world of smells river high at dawn going out to raise the gates i found the moon robin sits preening at the top of the plum tree in sunsets last rays running in the park a couple of joggers pace in the dawns first light rush of fresh currents boogie through the april bog birds come out to swing his tubs of roses surely of stock from the bush that blazed for moses same old road but over the fog a giant oak i never saw before sauna at midnight the lamp flashes on our sweat the moon chills the lake screaming screeching bird what black powers of night have robbed you of your rest sea lions sun on woodmill log rafts young boys drop crabpots in the bay sea sky lowly drifts storm waves curl mighty upwards as gentle rain they touch seems all i can see is that old rocking chair it looks so empty seems that it has always been this way the valley waiting on the rain seven rainbow colors the lower part of the ring hidden under a winter field she knows no english i know no japanese we share a pot of tea she rows into the reeds raises the oars and listens the heron flies away sheep bell on the hill black feet and face showing through thick morning mist shelter in spring the toes of the ten year old sprout through his shoes but wine on my breath this early in the morning gives it all away short walk home at  am smell of her love still on my fingers shrill laughter the room growing cold  the bookstores cat rubs against my legs shun not the brown toad he is a work of wonder golden eyes watching sign on foot winnebago everyone join us in our fight against the oil companies signing my name in the book i wrote the pen runs out of ink sister lost a doll mom a hutch dad the farmland i lost a chessboard sister lost a doll mom a hutch dad the farmland i lost a chessboard slant sun on the waves golden fish shoal after shoal burning in our nets small box from japan the smile of the clay buddha through the packing straw small brown branch two leaved floats beneath the bridge of shades into green sunflow smoothness on the brook i pause on the footlog and look down at stars sneak up slowly and you can see the sunsets shadow drink from the well snowtracks mark the path from the shed to the feeder birdsong fills the air snubbed to the tree root spider on bobbing leaf raft waiting out the flood so cold and so bright the pale moon quietly framed in the autumn night soaring with birds my eyes get lost in wisps of fog crossing daytime moon soft woolen sweater your wet mouth kissing my eyes spring rain on the snow softly the snow ends slipping through the pickets a hare and the rising moon someone broke wind in the bus dashing at full speed in the spring sunshine somewhere a phone rings but today it is not mine better stack some wood spider by the path all hes caught is evening dew and a plum petal i split open a maple log and find trees and a mountain in fog spring breeze in the park on the stone unicorns back a child flies away spring girls walk in malls old men on benches watching fall in love again squirrels in the park quarrel over peanut shells the bells of st mark s staring and staring at the stream something i can t see keeps making ripples stars are dissolving water beads shine on the wire moths press the cold pane starting to rise to the top of the wave the cormorant dives into it steam from the dye baths rising on a cool morning bitter in the throat still smoking with black hashish my pipe left among colored leaves on baudelaires graveslab stoking the ovens rising from the smoke and flames the names of the dead streaks of winter dawn and still they gaze eye to eye the mannequin pair struggling through the pine one last hill before the beach  gulls take off such rosy red cheeks have you been standing with your back to the stove suet on a string suspended from a snowy branch three sparrows make it spin summit now is all of the world nothing remains but a sea of cloud sun on my back at the edge of the ocean i hug the earth sunbrushed this stone shines with millions of years holding still in the west wind swept by the wind i sit in this mountain tree seeking the zen way te size of the rock growing larger in winter with drifts of new snow ten below zero man and boy walk through their breath to read old tombstones terre d anonymat ce pays qui chante en moi ne l ai pas choisi that first and last word which cannot be spoken and which cannot be heard that noble old man my husband he is laughing birds sing and dogs bark the arizonas log on the bottom of pearl harbor the names of the dead the blind woman i met on the wooden bridge heard too my hurt pause the boy gives a yellow rose to the wrinkled blonde wearing an ankle bracelet the burned woods in old ashes and charred snags the glow of vine maples the cat in winter sits on the tv he is a pompous black owl the chair lift rises we reach the mountain top strange look down on trees the cold morning rain through the gnawing of chain saws the cawing of crows the cold wind at dusk a coatless beggar asks me hey hows it going the crows caw nervous the white hawk hunts them as the sun hunts black the curl of a warm cat in a spot of sunlight on the floor the darkened sick room a buzzing fly in the heat beats on the window the dove is frightened and huddled in the corner loft forgets it can fly the dream fades wakened by a bird at the window that was my dream the edge of edges the beginning and the end do they have an ending the end of autumn high in the sky a bird struggling in the wind the farm creek footbridge a prison guard grasps my arm as it falls away the first day of spring walking and walking and walking in the prison cell the flowering of an olive branch in his bright hand a kind of singing the force that through the green fuse drives the flower drives my green age the fountain falls in love rises up to murmur i will give you all the freshly cut grass comes in on the childrens shoes the house is laughing the garden scarecrow an old man shrinks from his bones coming for a hug the goldenrod patch brown eyes count steps of the sun until day is done the goldfish in the school pond melt like crucifixes into the chests of children the great guest frog speaks from the bottom of my well in circular sounds the grove by the creek in the absence of cicadas the silence and heat the grove by the creek a cross of crumbling marble marks the mossy grave the hot park crowded a pet goose out of its box scolding its master the kite leaps from the hand like a hawk from the falconer loving sky the last page of chart added to his hospital file the gleam of sirius the late summer sun not afraid to dance on rolls of prison razor barb the leaves have fallen and the snow has fallen and soon my hair also the light goes out i looking around in the dark at whats been waiting the light goes out the boy next door backs away from his own reflection the little girl became good at doing cartwheels while waiting for the school bus the little white dog sniffs eagerly in my yard sh  get the shovel the long stone stairway has led to this secluded world of blossoming plum trees the long winter over three pennies left in my pea coat for i ching she lifts the gatelatch and smiles to herselfit creaks rust is on her hand wind spirits rush past to boldly caress her form and i call her name the mill wheels broken a swan weaves through yellow sedge here no laughter lifts bears walk on hind legs in a circle outside the river a long tear the name of the new cook is soft in the mouth of the waitress the neighbors one cow moos from the dark belfry of the old town church the old neighborhood with fresh paint and new faces the whores up the street the old starter whirred too cold to start my old crate hello triple a the orioles nest clings still to the winter branch though there are no eggs the owl falls silent the sound of the moon rising through the desert sky the perfect roundness of the shaker wide brim a peg to hang your hat the pond may be full but theres always enough room for the skinny ones the poplars chatter our words come close to winter hail on the lawn chairs the power of the circle is flown is sorrow to sleep in squared walls the rich winter warmth in just one stick of firewood shared with a stranger the river is low a still brown sky at top speed swallows sip themselves the rows of tombstones even on the coldest days you will find him there the same bright stars twinkle in the summer sky twinkle in the still pond the scent of clean sheets and a love song fill the room spring cleaning the school bus pulls away on the porch swing raggedy ann one red leaf the shell of her ear after making love listen the sound of the sea the smoke waves welcome from my chimney as i walk toward my empty house the snow has made my mock orange bush appear to bloom out of season the sound of release twisting the cap off a beer after the days work the sound of traffic but behind the wall the gardens of the heian shrine the sound of water but thats the kettle boiling now lets have some tea the spring flows outward in the moon of sweet grass sprouting birds chirping green the summer is over the woman sings to her horse as the children whine the summer passes and the circle from our tent grows faint in the grass the sun is human light the rock pile outside breeze moves the dying plant the sun you see is a picador ash a cape hiding a white bull the voices of march crackle and snap from tree to tree travel to nowhere the waves now fall short of the stranded jellyfish in it shines the sky the waves on her head finely beaded with hair spray mist dots the spiderweb she went to vassar my mother scrubbed on a school where they ride horses the young mans splendor all space and all time to stretch his legs in the young mans splendor all space and all time to stretch his legs in there are times when i must look into the sky and give up thinking there in the long grass the vagrants unmarked grave wind runs through the grass there is such sadness in your eyes yet the glory of spring beckons me theres a howling stray cat which indra says has the face of a woman these birch leaves flutter soft in the summer breeze and silvered by the moon these few large oak leaves falling in the still air a drift of snowflakes this ancient garden now swept by a petal wind the scene of a dream this book of kells and still that piper on the beach at galway bay this time truly making love doves bounce off a windowpane not dead just stunned this tricky sunshine fools a few fruit flies dead on the table at breakfast this way that way wild geese head south everyday now the sound of rifles though it hasn t moved the sun has changed the outlook of that dragonfly three crows comes a wedding day seven crows a death nana used to say three crows comes a wedding day seven crows a death nana used to say three lines of black birds in flight across a page white with unwritten words three men and three birds stand still in the forest all surprised by rain through the crowded market the faint fragrance of white peonies in the tin bucket through the long sermon on black and white right and wrong the mockingbirds song through the train window a boy at the orphanage gate is sucking his thumb through the underbrush above the rush of the brook the song of the thrush thrusting the price tag in the eye of the striped bass the eveing sun thunder in the hills and caves goldenrods mourn war echoes of frank n jess tides far sound the stars have come in again to lie among the stones tired old man not a tooth in his mouth hot corn on the cob tiring of the heat her mind tries out a divorce or maybe new shoes to greet the sunrise the silence of the frogs in shape of the shore to his room to rest for hours the faulty fan burning into his chest seen in your nesting camouflage once now to hear bitterns string bass struck  to the secluded pond the warmth of him behind me on the stepping stones told that bats hung in dark maple tops i clung to my uncles trousers too many words the dark in the cup of the dipper begins to spill touch of a loved one lingers in the curtainfolds and a breeze all night trying to escape from a shadow at my heels finding it is my own trying to set down my longing for him i watch the moon grow old trying to stir my wife from winter slumber our dog with a stuffed toy twice weekly villagers wait for bus and its cargo hot dusty loaves of bread two old friends matching tale for tale drink for drink logs pop and spit two people can be kept apart by a low wall low enough to leap the tallest redwood trees sink the deepest roots the great stream does not cease two weeks before spring days too short to read night notes on red paper unable to sleep my mind so full of thoughts all night long the wind under a hot sun coastbound cars stop for a turtle crossing to the marsh under the back steps catfish still flop in the pail the long august night under the maple tree the shadow of an inner tube swings on the snow under the moonlight a breeze is faintly blowing children are playing with their shadows up and through the snow purple flowers choose to bloom two new april graves up from the deep pools night lakes flood the bisquefired plains muskrats wake shimmers up up they all fly with a sudden rush of wings the wild ducks valentines day again and still the harlequin doll wears his heart on his sleeve voices in the dark in my neighbors woods a lantern floats through the trees waiting for a bus an old man draws dust circles with his white cane waiting for a bus an old man draws dust circles with his white cane walking the mill dam the wind swept voices of children drown in the foam wards island in snow the cold harbour holds the call of a single goose warm spring wind spirals last years leaves across the field going who knows where washedout bean plants in a sea of mud in a row of onion flowers watching a rainbow from the edge of a seacliff the wind at my back watching bearded waves what comfort are they to you old man by the sea waves climb seawall steps rain dances across the lake we watch in awed silence we kissed long and hard it is not easy to learn a foreign tongue we re going to treat you like family this offer ends in  days wedged into the radiator of the hit and run truck a splinter of crutch weight of a bee and a drop of dew slips from the bean tendril what do they see in it all those bees and butterflies the onion flower what is he thinking left out in the fall rain the scarecrow i made what the bulldozer does the cattail and wild rice where the old pond was whats up first a pelican in the hills now a hawk over the sea when i play music my heart becomes full of peace and its always spring when the poem comes i have an old envelope my friend has a pen where an eagle soars the spirit of air dances gift for my wind pipe where the old dog waits a fog of breath clings to the cold windowpane where we scarred the field a million daisies sprang up to cover our grief white birds in the grass the round backs of cows steaming after summer rain white stockings laced knees beneath her blue dres she knows a deep voiceless secret who the hell am i supposed to be supposing we assume i m not who will give me the skin of the snake as a gift of fate willing little monster i ll make a pet of him buttocks hard as rocks wind carve a tunnel through the earth and at the heart pause in ecstacy winters red sunrise sticking up in the tide flats ribs of an old dory with our old friends to view the moon and blossoms but only your face with the june breeze a cloud of fine hair rises from the sleeping cat with the tip of his cane the old man plays in a mud puddle with the young robins theres much more cocking of heads than catching of worms woman in the park you make your child a jewel wearing him in front worn ruts in the roadway only the sound of wind soughs in the woods woven in the sky with skeins of geese flying north the end of winter years pass but on the hill at sunrise my shadow still one block long yes cherry blossoms i see you ve come back again but she hasn t you dying tree yet from you in leaved gutter springs spined green goldfired bush a bird nests secure in the arms of a willow weep no more my lady a cat at the door with a kitten in her mouth snow under her feet a chauffeur on his way home from work sitting at the back of the bus a child is born but how long before her fingers won t hold other fingers a field of tall grass glistens as far as the mountain where the moon sets a frost at the fair steam rising in the moonlight from a mound of hay a letter from an old friend sorrow at the other end of the balancing board a little gray cat waits hidden in the tall grass one bright red leaf falls a little hope can like the stone rippling in the pond stir the souls surface a long way from shore the ice on the lake shifts with a snapping sound a moose lifts its head in the tent we hear water dropping from its muzzle a papaya in each hand i m glad that you have found my taro root a plate of cut apples turning brown in the sunny window and the old woman a soft breeze blowing the cool sound of the wind chimes and the dripping rain a tornup girlie magazine at the end of the woods road it begins to rain a tornup girlie magazine at the end of the woods road it begins to rain a wind comes off the ocean shaking all the car antennas in the parking lot about an inch of rain the lush green grass is alive with all those snails after fifty years the red cheeked lad fiddling to his dog on the whatnot shelf against a white world snow blows in from his dark shape standing in the door all night long the sound of rain mingles with the sound of river no sleep all souls two weeks gone still he sits here shrunken smile the jack o lantern all the short night long looming on the sick room wall shadows of the moon alone on the road my short legs are no trouble i will win this race an old trout leaping gaily in my pond for flies i will let it stay and the songs of summer and silk laid away now in the house of winter and the tide rolls in shells glisten in the last light night is upon us and tiny shivering trees just there for summers in barrels too small for tall roots as pesty as they are flies in the prison bus free to come and go at his desk he talks and talks of freedom and shreds a scrap of paper at the iron gate in front of walt whitmans tomb a stranger plays the flute shuffling down the hall across his rumpled tshirt when you re hot you re hot at the sick room door looking in on my mother the years of the war bare branch to bare branch a bluejay climbs the white birch the chill of autumn bats made unblind by the light dart with the grace of swallows devouring stunned butterflies bhusan now the man who went to the moon should be worshipped as a god black are the stars beams blacker yet the moon and sun while cold earth stiffens brought in tame from the eastern hills theres no telling how long he will last bug lights on the leaf takes a wild ride through the rapids then flies away buildings hide the sky and pavement the earth and yet this weed grew to seed butter lamps in rows nothing to lose an old monk reading sutras by their light by the one mailbox marking the end of the lane my old friend greets me ces amis qui nous visitent je crois tojours entendre la voix de leur fils mort clouds have filled the lake a great blue heron takes flight wings filling the sky curls of snow follow the furrows left by last years plow my hollows of loss dark red with rain the old barn smells of a wheat crop stored years ago desire cam quickly i knew it best to leave you now is not the time desire came quickly i knew it best to leave you now is not the time doomed to be felled the old apricot tree casts its small fruits one more time dumping the minnows out of the bucket onto the ground they leap toward the sky dusk in the orchard a catbird flicks its long tail and pecks a ripe peach emerging from the nuclear shelter how do you intend to live in the world alone eveningcicadas chorus a few more songs and i will be leaving this place for home the sun shifts now i wake to the dance of rainbows on my bedroom walls fields of corn stretching as far as the eye can see within a lost child first dream of the year i kept searching for something through a pile of bones fog sweeps by from behind a quickened step or two then warmth moistens my face fresh rain and down the stream goes the printed mud where the toads belly sat frog eggs on a branch heavy with muck from the pond my sailboat drifts by from knees on the bridge our guide measures the creeks depths with his walking slick first rose on the bush she lifts me to its perfume gives color a name from the coral reef the he e shoots out his arm at the green lobster from the darkened road through the leaves of the linden the far lights of home from the mouth of an abandoned tunnel a rusty stream and the smell of urine from the old castle i m looking down the river wet in the spring rain from the warlords tomb onto the street of caged birds each one in full song frost flowers bloomed in grass till the sun rang into day a reign of rainbows full moon on lhasa an old monk blows the conch shell and the mountains glow going out of my way to crunch them as i walk first leaves of autumn gold weeping willows you have not dropped one bright leaf what strength is in grief great men and grand ladies follow me round the room wax eyes on my breath green leaves in the park the twoyearold boys white teeth speak out a b c grey sky nearing my shadow sits down to a larger meal at the next table we make our own way to birth asking which is the long walk to death i want to make you roar with laughter as i ride you in the morning like ermine when i come to lick your winter salt my tongue freezes in blood man you write me so much you bad as the loanhouse asking fo they money hes wearing his name red shirt and signs the drum with a red felt pen hey old mosquito if you did not sing so loud you d see the sunrise his parents are having tea with his new girlfreind like a general inspecting his troops his private bridge jumping from stone to stone a small boy waves back to me holding on to love as if life depends on it in a way it does hopping in the grass where the road dips to the sea a little frog lost i cant pray out loud mommy when i talk to god i sort of scribble i close my eyes and see your hand in my hair your thighs inviting flesh i pray for peace in the world hands folded over the place where you sleep i throw back curtains for her to dress in sunlite the rivers folds of ice i throw my pack on from far through the trees a wren stutters into song i will hear much from the vast sense of hearing the mind of my mind i d like to linger here and there with indra as though we were homeless in both hands the child is holding an ice cream cone the summer heat wave in early spring fog the old man stands on the grave a fistful of violets in the knoll of grass once barren  the delight of change on the rise in the french dry stand the world series is turned down to hear her order in the grips of pain seeking the perfect haiku  ah  the peacock plume in the hard wet sand i trace the long days journey of a vagrant snail in the old mission up the stairwell to the bell the monk and cold wind in the picture book a popup figure of a cowboy stands with a bent carbine in the small dark room one bare bulb dangling ragged on its cord so still in the souvenir flute left from the trip the reedy song of the cane workers in the steady rain red leaves from the old gnarled elm fill the open grave in this brief dream a tiny bird is singing his notes as thin as string in this town even the cats go begging for more than we can give them young boys play in pairs touch the war weapons tanks guns dreaming blood and death it must have taken years of sea gulls shitting to turn those brown cliffs white jardin de papier sous de pluies de songes en fleur l encre est d arcenciel jazz from a naked speaker on the edge of the bathtub wondering what to do last gold butterfly so close it drinks from my hair paper birch leaf rites  late april at dusk song birds and soft greying clouds set the world to peace let lilies come and an orange un in the morning i ve done with winter like a ghost she came hung up the laundry and went dripping in the grass like a wild bird he sees theres nothing to be afraid of in my room look the morning wind whips lace branches to storm seas still the root rests still lying side by side tracing the scars of your life in soft folds of skin mary kept these things and pondered them in her heart she is still so young mid great works of art a child hand over her eyes in a pointing spin mornings drift of snow here the wind was a spiral there it had a groove moving from boat to boat as they swing in the current hunting the freshest mangos my hand fits in yours mommy was it like that when i was a baby my lady friends dog its hair still clings to my clothes the end of spring my lover calls at work i hope the boss hasn t fought with her husband near the waters edge fish are swimming in the trees birds fly through the lake new sod on the broken ground and over the grave a grief of white lilies night sky and black fog alone upon the rock cliffs gone is the north star no breeze tonight june bugs cling to the screen door late late show on tv no matter how hard a young man tries the world is more corrupt dim he not a bird in flight and in the lone pulse of night one cricket wondering not a cloud in the sky a blue butterfly balancing on a glass wind chime not that i am old even tender days of spring see can make me cry not you but the cat against the curve of my back wind rattling the panes shoes off pants rolled up feet burrow in sand for clams the size of jewels wood chips rain my face stay awake  the woodpecker tolls in a dead limb now winter has come the name on her mailbox buried in the last deep snow o red brigade of love ants crawling on the wall i hold out my hand on a clear fall night the cherry tree though leafless is full of bright stars palms spread on night moving glass cops fingers sliding down my groin searching for drugs on late autumn evenings when the sly breeze ignores obstacles gathering to drink plum wine on my last journey alone on the road at dawn first sight of the sea on my neighbors lawn an ash tree the christmas lights flash on and flash off on the hot bus an old man licking his lips strokes her with his eyes on the smooth river a group of ducks one of gulls snow falls on them one bird flying hard against the storm wind and snow where in march to go one nurse the other in out in her room i m not waiting out here one of us scarecrows isn t lifting a hand to help sweep the garden path one touch of the toad and i laugh to feel my skin fifty years older only gone a day or two how could the blossoms come and go without me our cave guide tells us we re in absolute darkness my fingers touch damp moss our white cat gone the flower pot where she perched holds a mound of snow packing out the doe at dusk we cut bobcat tracks and drag marks swirls gone painting a still life to the pale green of cabbage the pale green of worm par deux fois la plainte du train dans la nuit ranime sa doleur en moi passing the wild plum my hair snags on a low branch snow falling on snow past the planes great wing a strip of thin grass shimmers in the jet wind a too witty tongue half the town with the wish his neck would be wrung peoples bodies feel cold in the tohuku district while cherry blossoms bloom at their best prayers for the birth of god a mandata of light high in the cathedral darkness pulling at his beard he turns his face to the sky leans on his rake range after range of mountains year after year after year i am still in love rare waxwing you need but perch for a moment to make the world your friend resting on the rocks a boy with his fishing pole and the old mans dreams rowing with sis not the man i thought i was she says with mock fear mornings they used to wheel her out over the brown leaves to watch us play sand slowly fills the ears of the shells the sound of the sea grows muffled she rises early to watch a mouse eat the seeds she left for the birds six snow crowned young pines stand in line waiting for their maestros cue to dance ski troops in the rockies the whiteness of their tents are one with the snow sleet on the pane    blackberries from my woods bubbling in a cobbler small things of the world arc out far touch and brighten we call them roselieps smiles can melt the snow love flies flies on wings of light evergreen my friend snow weight on the pine and rice on my head a wedding months too soon so quiet a night of snow and yet the cries of birds on white branches someday when you call shall not be there to hear i will be all right sparrow bathes in warmth but wades out to the cool fount to sate his thirst spiders in the corner don t you be anxious i won t break your webs spring brings new garments to the meadow bees are pleased warm sun and fresh breeze standing in a row the boys throw stones to break the thin floe of ice still before the storm a leaf falls from the oak tree and sounds like thunder still wet the street shines rain beads sparkle and a boy on his new bicycle stuck to a log in my woodbox the moth wakes up too early for spring summer twilight fades    only a few more circles the webll be done sun dips in the sky this late in the afternoon bluebells paint the prairie blue table of old men singing a drunken chorus of dont sit under the apple tree talking of fresh corn a big man with farmers hands picks at his fast food tea of star anise her life will never be the same inside a child flutters she wear the pants red dish and tight what is under neath nature hills fly the air full of music my face soaring in a frame halfway up the wall the august blue spruce think not to do very much they need a good storm the bane of sea gulls seeking clams theyve dropped on rocks their own fresh poop the birds of the sky and the airplanes of the ground are alike oh my the blind girl having black coffee asks to touch the lemon slices in my tea the blind girl she too sits close to the pianist to get a closer look the boy tilts his head his toy gyroscope spins dust through a slant of sun my altar for dreams each night i make an offering pillow on which i sleep the caw of a crow from one of these cypresses that jut from the rocks the christmas wreath hung an old man goes out to look for the christmas star the cove a frog jumps into a splash a white heron lifts out of nowhere the dog almost died here i am now taking lunch with all my good friends the dragonfly hangs on the screen i m looking at him hes looking at me the edge of the knife fogged for an instant as i set my teaspoon down the emptiness of a tin can on a scrap pile next to a green field the emptiness of a tin can on a scrap pile next to a green field the gray lake reflects gray sky a flight of wild ducks traces a faint line the kid in front of me scratches his head whats that crawling on my desk the little man who changes bulbs is stopping off to dust the paper ladys sunglasses her steps outside yet here trail the fencedoes she know its wood is my flesh the moon breaks through clouds and the frog on the log leaps back into darkness the moon in the west a bison stands like a grove on the snowy field the morning after all of the red wine i drank has gone to my eyes the night is moonless each small snowflake brings with it its own kind of light the old white cherry back by the shed where no one goes blooming like mad the outdoor bath snow falls on my shoulders as i sit in the steaming water the plop of paddle blade dips ash leaf mold whirlpools swirl away in the heat the priests leave the old ones rush to fill their pails with the icy flow thats mrs browns her son was so bad he ran away and joined the navy the river is calm two ducks swim in the night light spreads in their wake the roar of the crowd off to one side little boys play their own game the shape of cold is small until it crumbles and then it wraps and then the sound all night of the hamster in its wheel and my wife not here the sun goes out on the raised paddle a chill wind comes off the mountain the young girls eyes match the color in the sky less than two hours ago them softly sipping from the stream the doe and fawn i ll not frighten them these leaves will not fall they twist their withered gold points nesting next years buds thinking how long i ve been hungry i walk in verdant paddy a breeze stirs this morning from a frog i hear all i need to hear about the pond this soil cracked and dried split by hot summer breezes will not take my seeds this speck on the page that blowing doesnt remove has a mind of its own three birds on a journey rest roadside sense my presence then take off in fright three dollars a drink i ll ferment my own while we wait here for takeoff three sides of the elm seemed much the same in winter till i looked again through a blur of pain i count cracks on the ceiling never twice the same through my window one night the moon and i stared but oh i blinked first through the charred rafters the face of a barn owl white as the hunters moon throwing down her cane the sinks to the ground beside it bedded in bright leaves time moves on and on yet still in heard silence we sense you are near tired of walking i pour hot tea from the thermos bent reeds in the wind to cross buck creek with wagon loads of wheat they laid a bed of straw today the world of the  things wakes me with the racket of two sparrows town funds might cover school repairs if the mayors house can spare a third coat trees bend in the park a flung handful of birdseed takes off and flies south trees grown tall and fat leave the moon no need for clouds to hide behind twisted on his arm in a quiet bar the snake slides toward the cold beer urine and propane in the air the streetcar waits alone for the light to change watching my gun she won t eat the meat the dog i have to shoot we ve picked green apples and placed them in a glass bowl evening light gathers on the other side of the wall a tower guards field glasses against my chest what do bishops take when the price of bread goes up a vow of silence what shall i tell you of these mountains i have trod for too many years when i am happy it seems ive never been sad eyes see through the heart when i ride my bike wind blows and blows the trees leaves fall within touch when she picked the rose along the banks of the pond she picked the reflection when the room is dark you will have only the sky moth at the window when the sun came out my turtle climbed on a rock and conjured a view where is my friend to whose house have i come roses in the still air white crane wades through reeds wind soughs through bamboo thickets faint low sound of flutes wind just banged my gate for this view through the pine of the rising moon windless gray sky yet leaves whirled as one around me each in its own dance windy new years night the last bus turns around at the end of its run with both hands she holds her coffee mug the old woman basking in its steam with its fogshroud the bridge looks like the gate to heaven the water is deep with love on my mind i go to kiss her suddenly a door slams shut with my head in your lap i am overwhelmed by the pulse in your thigh with too much to drink he finds a voice to phone me this autumn evening with too much to drink he finds a voice to phone me this autumn evening without food and water for a week the buried baby shes alive shes still alive woe i have just found that barbies dresses cost more than mine le beau monde woven like the petals of the hyacinth the purple sash around the young girls waist yes i heard your call but the waltzing clouds kept me lying in the grass you may feel something he says just now i feel it i cannot ell him your eyes reflect stars and the moon drops close to earth i feel your essence your eyes reflect stars and the moon drops close to earth i feel your essence your words as we drive pin my eyes to your mouth blur of wild lilac a fork in the road on the way to the farmhouse the pair of white oaks a hump of pumpkins on the stone steps the blank stare of the old white house a white mask at noon is worn by the old cripple he speaks his name twice all at once the doe at the edge of the woods the flag of her tailup and how much you want to bet when the world is sane ill be beautifully insane as i throw my pack on from far through the trees a wren stutters into song as she sorts sea shells her fingers filled with the sound and smell of the sea as the soap bubbles all my life is left to the wind blowing to and fro at the edge of dusk two men drive a fence pile deep into the green earth at the famous site straining to see the tidal bore shoes damp from the tiny ripples at the yard sale an old man wants to buy the mirror his wife turns away at the yard sale an old man wants to buy the mirror his wife turns away blast fast rev em up zap em nuke em o good lord thanks for micro waves ce noeud de cravate que je fais pour ma fille moi qui en porte si raremaent cheese is like a house cheese is a mouses mansion a house is a man s dawns light spreads through rain our dog cleans the fungus from the webs of her paws down through the winter light and shadows of the sick room a spider on a thread farther and farther the hat carries the sunset down the hill a low evening bell sounds fresh corn on the cob my child nibbling just two rows the way i used to from the general i see first your face think first i m here i made it ghost swans glide by us moved only by moon night air and the lakes dark pull goose lying on beach with top of head blown open still alive and bleeding on sand he took honey from the walls of his house thats where the bees hide their hives heart of the ghost firs blue mist moves under smoked silk her breast comes rare pink here we have no names you cup the moon in your hands trees shadow the snow hesitation mrs k is going to give me the tulips that i have in my garden hoping to show me the owl he is slow to name what hovers in the dusk hordes of babushkas and a few young men push and shove to kiss the gold cross how much of the strength giving wind can that pine tree stand when is too much i am to be judged but they cannot know my soul things my heart would say i paint snow scenes to keep cool in the summer heat it does not work well i watch your slow walk you stroke my beard we softsuck juice from this brief peace ice packs by the bridge pouring through a new channel the town goes back to work if its two o clock youre the only bird awake if four you re the first if we meet on the outside it ll be different the young gogo girl  i in spain i climbed mountains i have dishes and spoons now my hair stays in place in the autumn night the tap of the blind mans cane comes back through the mist in the stream a perch on the earth a summer breeze in the sky a comet last night in my dream you were here the pillow is creases empty but still warm leaf why must you rush to the brown and ugly weeds when autumn sun shines bright lies in the name of christ i turn on the channel to a story about lilies lifted by a gust of wind a pink wildflower falls and stays on the naked grave light flies on the wind all night drifts blown off to stars now dawn melts venus look how the sun lights the rows of corn we ll buy land and become farmers look the big dipper s hot hot hot lightyeared far stars cold fire fly blinds me gazed into the sphere and spoke the ninth of june and my death from a stroke morning sun on my porch on the abacus of a column a swallows nest comes alive moth on the screen moon in the sky on the lake a knock at the door neons flash red and green april rains on still street man nods red lights blink blink night falls then a slow rock thumps it is the artist s tortoise pale and white the fat crows peruse the stubbled field the birch and i watch from a safe distance on the walk to school my hair dances with the wind leaves waltz in the gutters psst pass this to her i like you do you like me yes no circle one qw oo ack quack quack qwak cries the new mountainborn lake sky wings back kawe  rattle of the night train my hand trembles beneath your blouse the moon does not move a brown oak tree leans in the arms of his brother squirlls leap limb to limb rooftops in fog are dull green and gray beneath them the poor at least are dry said the dreamspeaker once there was the hammock and the deathcradle offered to a white wind sea waves slap the face of rocks that face the sea waves slapping faces of rocks sixth day of our wedding journey we cross this summer valley where jacksons men once marched small bird forgive me i ll hear the end of your song in some other world someone made up my eyes while i slept i couldn t find out who did it soon my elm will die and the strong young oaks must grow for my childs children sudden rain at sea in from the cruise ships wet deck they dance two by two the ash tree leafless while we made love spider spun his web on the clock hands the birch trees in late summer wave in the darkened woods dropping their scrolls of bark the blind mans breath as he taps his cane from side to side bitter cold twilight the brain is a womb i like to walk in the softness scratching in red dirt the doll on the bed dressed in red satin and lace sits up with the dead the flick of high beams out of the dark roadside ditch leaps a tall grass clump the parts of my lawn i love best are the bare spots where my children play the wire fence is tall the lights in the prison barracks flick off one by one the sharp sound of pain and the dove squirming in the grip of a raven hawk the stars and stripes the bear and olympic rings b l o w i n g the wages of sin he begins  and the hurt of silence takes over for him the woman lying in sickbed claims my hands are still so cold the ruddy hibiscus flower this mirror shows me more than i want to see less than i want to know tired of job hunting on a side street i stop to pick a sackful of mulberries today i sit and think of what i want to do and the cars pass by turning over in bed your shoulders the soft steps of the deer i saw at dawn who watched him dress in three shirts two pairs of pants for want of a coat your lips brushed my cheek i thought for a moment that you meant me to stay a white line of snow hugs the north side of the log a frog stirs in mud against the pine bark one lock of hair a bear lost to the teeth of his brush at end of the last class the teacher locks the door to leave books of short stories gulls rise as a cloud and fly out to sea then turn back all but a few i works hard but treated bad man i se telling you de truth i full of it hesitating a second at the top the rollercoaster hangs above the beach then thunders out of sight i tear open the letter from tokyo the sun a cherry haze hangs on in the west il n y aura rien rien qu un ciel bleu et du vent pour taire le peine in the mirror too alone november evening the wind from a passing truck ripples a roadside puddle into may now and the rhubarb has grown to seed rootrobbed it wont do well next year lit by a street light the face of a child tongue up to meet the first snow x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x opening his new book and hearing the haiku in his voice i who never heard his voice outside the museum i pass in the shadow of the billboard girl with flowers in her hair pray pray she doesn t blow ash and grit pray or you ll see angels on rooftops pray pray she doesn t blow ash and grit pray or you ll see angels on rooftops putting a piece of watermelon on a cup of ice cream a fat woman in a sweat survivors in small boats looking for a new place to live the war drags on and on thinking how long i ve been hungry i walk in verdant paddy the sound of the breeze through the gaps in the barn the trees through the gaps in the trees the rising sun to pick them off she d have to unclasp her friends hand burrs on her torn skirt two men on a plank all thats left of the billboard girl floats off in the wind we talk of our past my wife picks wax from a candlestick burns it on the flame when you close your eyes in the sun all you want is the sun on your eyes an old pine knot the way he held it in his hand the way he looked at it neighbors are up late i can t quite hear what they say i can t quite not hear so hard to start on a blank page i go out to shovel a path to the street so hard to start on a blank page i go out to shovel a path to the
