winter night
without the heat
of his company

a neat pile
of all your letters
before I burn them

love again
the scent of cypress
after rain

wild beaches
in winter time--
take me there

first kiss --
behind the bookshelf
her scent lingers

the bottle empty
but my head still
full of you
beyond the window,
a low-hanging moon

my neighborâ€™s
apricot tree is blooming
secondhand love

intertwined
in my washing machine,
my daughter's bras
and the jeans of
her latest boyfriend

crescent moon -
leaning her head
against my shoulder

my wife
home from hospital
hibiscus in full bloom

fresh peaches --
the wet print of your body
on the pool deck

warm drizzle
cinnamon buns
and tea for two

march warmth
the taste of curry
on his lips

month-old obit
of an ex-girl friend
unexpected rain

my wife
home from the hospital
hibiscus in full bloom

at opposite ends
of the reading room
ex-lovers

summer love
a faded red t-shirt rots
in the gutter

full moon
he smoothens a wrinkle
on her hand

Soft rain
her thoughts of lost love
intrude into her day

Tropical storm warning
Wet sand in our kisses
The opening sky

words
we've left unsaid-
Indian summer

fresh tea
the warmth of his lips
on mine

Another day without him
she misses all the little things
still, the sun shines

3 am
a cycle moon 
thoughts of him
crowd my brain
and takes my sleep

Summer strawberries---
they always remind me
of soul kissing

On the pillow
his bouquet of wild flowers
this last day of Spring

first time--
your curly hair
tickled my thighs

steady Spring drizzle---
a couple stop
to kiss

more than the shining sun
in the morning
I want her

year's first hot day---
East River lovers
smooch in their cars

vernal equinox
my days and nights now measured
not in hours
but by our time together
and apart

she's found the gate
in the wall of willows
sunlight of spring

spring wind
on my neck
cooler than your breath

black lace and moonlight
her underthings draped
over the chair

wet starless night --
a smiling moon shines
on her umbrella.

Valentine's Day
we let the champagne
go flat

in the mist
waiting to meet you-
budding crocus

Chilly morning
Memories of a love affair
Floating in my mind

love letters -
i rake the embers
of the fire

long winter
my wife slows her pace
to mine

returning spring
in the dawn light she looks like
my first love

winter's cold
dreaming
of my ex-wife

cold rain
the persistent warmth
of your kiss

autumn wind
knowing what you
will say next

Side of the road
flowers a deep shade of blue
thoughts fly to you

chrysanthemum moon
the way
you open me

leaf after leaf falls
the way your laugh
makes me laugh
